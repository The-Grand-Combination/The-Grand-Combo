avantgarde_art_desc;The dawn of the 20th century saw the creation of the most innovative movement until that moment. Rising from the ashes of Advancementism, from which inherited the eager desire for innovation, Avant-Gardism had just one goal: the complete destruction of every precedent concept and rule, in total contrast with the precedent artistic movements. This meant the rejection of the Zombie Apocalypse itself as an event of great importance and in the Avant-Gardist works there isn't a single mention of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

expressionist_art_desc;While the Neoromantics limited themselves to the adoration of a past that could be considered relatively near, the Ancientists took it a step further and started admiring the art of the more distant antiquity. Throughout all the movement there was the will to emulate the works that stood the test of time, and even that of the Zombies. The clearest demonstration of this phenomenon was the building of countless arches in innumerable cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

impressionist_art;Neoromantic Art;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
impressionist_art_desc;The emulation of the pre-Apocalypse past became almost an obsession among the Neoromantic, whose only goal was to reignite the artistic flame the Zombies had so violently put out. They based their art on the same premises of the Romanticism, using the few works of the era that hadn't been lost in the turmoil of the previous decades as examples to follow blindly. Some of them even venerated the artists of that period as incarnations of God on earth, and created the Cult of the Greats, a sect that seeked to reach their perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jazz;Gjrablii;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jazz_desc;'Gjrablii means all, and means nothing. It's the perfect word for the perfect music.' This declaration marked the beginning of one of the most influential musical genres of the 20th century. Founded by the eccentric John Paradox, Gjrablii, or Ghjrablyi, or Hrabbiyi (Q for short) was characterized by the constant presence of sounds made by metal bars of various types and shapes falling to the ground. This kind of innovative music became the most famous Avant-Garde in term of mass popularity and, shortly after John Paradox' death, it grew to become a big industry, involving million of dollars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

modern_design_desc;'That chair is fluctuating' said the little kid, with the eyes full of marvel. 'It is indeed, and that's thanks to the greatest discovery of them all: the AntiGravitatron9000!'\nDespite what many sellers, or charlatans, said, the Avant-Gardists didn't succed in their fight against gravity. They lost miserably. Nevertheless, they left us with some exquisite designs of splendid furniture pieces and, at the end of the day, that's what matters the most.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

realist_art_desc;Desperationism was born out of the destruction left by the Zombie horde. Their members, having dealt with a much more dark and crude reality than their romantic predecessors, portrayed reality in a was less idealized way. For their paintings they used predominantly the black and the red, the colors that had become associated with the Zombies and the many deaths they had left behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The writers belonging to this movement abandoned all the frivolous novels, deemed ridiculous, in favour of genres that they believed more worthy of attention in their era of despair and sorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

There weren't many composers that joined this movement, but the few who did produced great works of art that expressed the sadness and utmost despondency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
