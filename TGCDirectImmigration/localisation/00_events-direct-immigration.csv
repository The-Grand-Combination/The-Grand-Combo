EVTDESC980000;Direct immigration adds two new province buildings to the game. The province selector determines where pops will move from and the immigrator determines where pops will move to. Adjust decisions to choose whether you move primary, accepted, non accepted pops to other states or colonies. If you started a campaign with this submod, you must not disable it, as it will mess up some basic game mechanics. It works vice versa, do not use the mod on already started campaigns. Fresh saves only! For more information, check "how does this work again" option. Sidenote: Direct Assimilation Feature: To assimilate CORE cultures, build Immigrator buildings in provinces where you would like to assimilate. Do this with Direct Migration Campaign (disable direct migration in immigration options event) DISABLED. You can not assimilate and move pops at the same time. This building will also help assimilate non-core province cultures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME980000;Direct Migration Menu;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA980000;Explain me how this works again?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB980000;Remove immigrators;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC980000;End the Immigration Campaign, this will remove all the buildings and migration will revert to normal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD980000;Add buildings to 100k provinces;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE980000;Disable direct immigration.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF980000;Actually we don't have any desire to do anything at this time;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC980003;We have began forcibly removing certain parts of our population from one region to another. There is a great deal of confusion, violence and conflict caused by government disruption of normal life in this state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME980003;Explusion Horrors;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA980003;It must be done;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC980004;You can only build a maximum of five province selectors at any one time. Going over the limit will delete any surplus buildings. Unfortunately, this event may unavoidably spam if you have province selectors in construction, it will continue to do sountil your extra province selectors are built and can be cleared by the game. Maybe that'll make you remember not to try to cheese it next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME980004;You've gone over the limit!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA980004;Okay, fine;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC980005;We have began forcibly removing certain parts of our population from one region to another. The target provinces are reasonably alarmed at this development, as well as the population that is being moved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME980005;Lingering side-effects;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA980005;They'll live;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC980006;In short, with decisions that you unlock upon starting a DM campaign, you decide who you will move, and towards where. You can choose between primary, accepted, or non accepted cultures moving to state or colonial provinces. Exact emigration location (from where they will go) is decided by §GProvince Selector§!, and its target is decided by §GImmigrator Selectors§! (to where they are going). Decisions have been redone to more clearly explain what are you currently doing, and what you will be doing upon changing focus. Beware, maximum of province selectors is now §RFIVE§!. An option to move non-state religion population has also been added. When you decide to stop direct migration, enact migration options decision and choose to end the campaign. Next time you wish to start it, merely re-enact the decision. If you accidentally build an immigrator where you did not wish to, or you wish to change it to another location, simply choose the option to clear all immigrators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA980006;Thank you;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME980007;Direct Assimilation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC980007;There is a random province event chain (National Assimilation) that enables the player or AI to initiate assimilation of populations that would otherwise be protected by culture cores. Essentially, the over-protective culture core effect is removed, and if your other modifiers allow, you will be able to gradually assimilate the current non-accepted populace. This allows the player to target a specific state, rather than a random one, with a brief campaign, without having to wait for all of the modifiers to play out in the original event chain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA980007;Lets assimilate this state!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB980007;Actually, lets try another one. (this will trigger the event again in 30 days);;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC980007;I changed my mind;;;;;;;;;;;;x
