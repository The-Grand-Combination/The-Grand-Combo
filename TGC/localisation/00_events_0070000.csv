EVTDESC72738;After the Crusade for Canada, great swaths of lands came under American control. Both Anglo and French Canadians were liberated thanks the Treaty of Philadelphia. France has recently offered to purchase Quebec from us citing cultural bonds and the need to undo the wrongs of the British Empire done against French Canadians. Some in Washington are in favour of such a deal believing that America is an Anglo nation that French Canadians could never integrate in. There is also the fact the French are currently offering a large sum in exchange for Quebec and America is always in need of more funds. Others argue it would be wrong to transfer Quebec to France without first ensuring French Canadians have a right to home rule even if France would not likely pay the full price currently on the table.

EVTDESC72743;The Mexican War of Independence ended in 1821 with the signing of the Treaty of Cordoba on August 24 and the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire on September 28 of that year. This act was the result of the negotiations of the different factions participating in the war, including Juan O'Donojú, the last viceroy of New Spain on behalf of the monarchy. However, Spain would not recognize the treaties and the declaration on the grounds that O'Donojú was unable to make such arrangements. Now, Mexico has come to us again with a proposal for a treaty of peace and friendship between our two countries.

John Quincy Adams once said the United States does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy, and yet how foolish are we for bringing the beast to our very doorstep. The War Hawks in Washington promised to bring the American people to glory, but instead have brought disaster upon this great nation. Not only does Canada remain under British rule, but now several of the United States northern territories along with our gains from the Oregon Wars have been lost. To make matters worse, all of New England is now under the domain of the imperial crown. Riots against the statesmen in the District of Colombia for their ignorance are bound to break out. This will be a day that forever haunts the American spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The position of kingmaker is a precarious one, though, and we should consider very carefully to who we should offer this crown. They will certainly be indebted to us, but we should be careful not to draw the ire of those who would have chosen another. \n \n The Swedish house of Bernadotte is young and comes from humble origins, having been elevated to this position by Napoleon himself, only to turn with the winds and fight against him securing their place in the world. The Danish house of Oldenburg is an ancient and prestigious dynasty who harken from the rulers of the original Kalmar Union. Between these two powers stands Norway, who has for centuries been ruled by Danish and Swedish kings, a pawn in their wars - if instead of these two houses, we give the crown to a Norwegian noble of our selection, their loyalty might be more secure. \n \n Who shall it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC72751;At the expense of most of their colonial possessions, the Iberian Peninsula is under firm $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control. While the most obvious choice is to have Iberia ruled by the Spanish majority and governed in the centrally located city of Madrid, there are arguments to be made in favour of the peninsula’s other nationalities. In contrast to Spanish who were facing revolts both Carlist and colonialist alike, Portugal has experienced relative stability. Perhaps they would be better fit to administer Iberia? On the other side of the peninsula are the Catalans. The best way to quell their nationalistic tendencies might to give them a nation look after. There are some who argue that to exert control, the ruling elite must be kept to small minority and have therefore recommended the Basque. One more thing to note, is a letter has recently been received petitioning for the Galicians although this might be some sort of practical joke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The German diet has called for the Leipzig Congress to discuss the formation of a unified German state. The capital was decided to be same city where the Congress was held. Leipzig served not only as a strategic capital due to its distance from France, but as a symbolic capital due to it being the site of the Battle of Nations, where in 1813 a German coalition had defeated the First French Empire. \n \n The goal of this new German Confederation is clear: to liberate all oppressed Germans from French rule, the die has been cast in Europe for great and terrible war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME72754;The Question of the Italian Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72754;Although $COUNTRY$ has tried to control the Italian peninsula through the creation of Lombardy, Sicily, and the Papal rump state, the fires of Italian nationalism continue to burn. Many in Vienna are of the opinion that a unified Italy is impossible to avoid, and it is best that the Italian state be created peacefully through $COUNTRY_ADJ$ guidance rather through a bloody revolution. Others argued that a unified Italy will quickly grow out of our control. Either way a decision must be reached on what to do with Italy. The question then arises who shall rule the Italy. Should it be Lombardy in the north? Perhaps the legacy of Austrian rule in Milan will result in a loyal and capable subject? On the other hand, the rulers of Sicily were once of Habsburg blood, and it could be wise to keep things in the family.
