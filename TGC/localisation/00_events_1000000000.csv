The land is currently sparsely populated, mostly by natives, and they wish to establish a settlement there.

EVTDESC2000000002;Ever since the early 1700s Germans from mainly Lorraine have been settling in the areas of Banat and Vojvodina.

EVTDESC2000000004;In the 12th century King Geza II of Hungary (reigned 1141-62) invited Germans to settle and defend relatively sparsely populated Transylvania. Ever since then Transylvania, known as Siebenbuergen to its German settlers, had a sizeable German minority. When Germany recently unified with the Austrian Empire the Region was left to Hungary without any guarantee for protection of the German minorities and their culture.

EVTDESC2000000005;Despite being nominally still ruled by the Habsburg Monarch for a long time after its independence, said King never had true power over "his" government ever since Hungary seperated from Austria. With the conclusion of the war with Germany the Habsburgs were returned to true power in Hungary, as a proxy for the interests of the newly formed greater Germany of course. Since the von Habsburg Monarch also rules the Archduchy of Austria within the German Empire the fate of Hungary is tied to that of Germany as long as this arrangement lasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
