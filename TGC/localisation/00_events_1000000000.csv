EVTDESC1904191417;The call has come for Tabasco to join Yucatán, a union of two brother-states which will tend to the needs of their people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191417;Incorporation of Tabasco;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191417;We will answer the call!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191417;We will remain independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191418;Representatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have informed us that they have no interest in joining Yucatán.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191418;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191418;We will accept their decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191418;Willingly or not, they will join.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191419;Wyke–Aycinena Convention of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191419;Our foreign minister Pedro de Aycinena y Piñol has negotiated a deal with British Consul Charles Lennox Wyke. In exchange for our acknowledgement that the territory between the Belize and Sarstoon Rivers is a part of the British settlement, and not $COUNTRY$, the British will allow us to purchase needed weapons and to build a road between Ciudad de Guatemala and Belize Town to improve communication with our Atlantic coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191419;An Atlantic connection would greatly boost our trade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191419;I don’t think we’ll ever get that road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191420;Sell Fort Ross to the Mexican citizen John Sutter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191421;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to sell the Fort Ross trading post to us! Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191422;The British have come forth to us with a proposal to settle the border between our state of Yucatan and their colony of Belize. In order to prevent future conflict and the native encroachment on our respective territories, they propose that we set the border at the Rio Hondo river. While this would mean we would be renouncing some territorial claims, this treaty would also help us bring the problem of the rebellious Maya in Yucatan under control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191422;The Belize-Yucatan Border;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191422;No. That land is rightfully ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191422;We cannot afford for this to escalate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191423;The Mexicans have refused our generous offer. Our only recourse is force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191423;Mexico has refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191423;Our military could use the target practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191423;We don’t need this to come to a war yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191424;The Hay–Herbert Treaty has set up an arbitration tribunal with equal membership from all sides to determine which nation’s claims in Alaska are to be honoured, and now the tribunal has reached a decision in favour of:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191424;Hay–Herbert Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191424;The tribunal finds in favor of $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191424;The tribunal finds in favor of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191425;It is not what we expected, but we accept the tribunal’s decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191425;Alaska Arbitration Tribunal of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191425;We thought they were our friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191426;As expected, the tribunal was flawed from the beginning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191426;Alaska Arbitration Tribunal of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191426;Our friendship with our neighbour is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191427;The Belgian Government has come to us with an offer to lease the territory of Santo Tomás de Castilla to the Compagnie belge de colonisation under the protection of King Leopold I of Belgium. The land is currently sparsely populated, mostly by natives, and they wish to establish a settlement there. While some view the issue pragmatically - the land is unused, and the money from the lease and connections to an European market would help our economy - others feel like it is a betrayal of the independence that was fought over not one generation ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191427;A Belgian Colony in Guatemala?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191427;What do we care for a swamp inhabited only by a few natives?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191427;We did not throw off the Spanish so that we could invite the Belgians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191428;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has accepted our proposal of an indefinite lease on the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191428;A Belgian Colony in Guatemala?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191428;Send the settlers our, we will make Santo Tomás our own;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191428;On second thought, we would rather spend the money elsewhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191430;Mexican troops have marched to the border at Soconusco and we have received an ultimatum from the Mexican government: leave Soconusco or face war. Can we fight this war? The Texan rebellion certainly showed the weaknesses of the Mexican army, especially in difficult terrain, but our numbers are few and our forces undersupplied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191430;Mexico threatens Soconusco;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191430;There is nothing we can do - send the garrison home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191430;We will defend our territorial integrity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191431;Disease has wrecked the colony of Santo Tomás! Many of our settlers have already perished and the crops are failing. Many of the original investors in the colony are losing interest and liquidating their assets. If the colony is to continue, we would have to buy out the plantations and infrastructure and invest more into making the colony viable long-term. But is it worth it, for a few coffee beans?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191431;For a few coffee beans more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191431;Buy them out and reinvest in the colony. The cash crops will pay for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191431;Cut our losses and abandon the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191432;Disease has wrecked the colony of Santo Tomás. The Belgian settlers, those that survived, are returning to Belgium, and the settlements and plantations lie abandoned. While the lease of the land was perpetual, it doesn't look like they will be coming back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191432;The Belgians abandon Santo Tomás;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191432;Oh well..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
