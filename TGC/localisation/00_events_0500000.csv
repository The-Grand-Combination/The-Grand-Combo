EVTDESC500000;The Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland was a Statute which replaced the Constitution of 1815 in the aftermath of the failed November Uprising in the Russian Partition. The Statute was pronounced in occupied Warsaw on March 1832 by Marshal Ivan Fyodorovich Paskevich, who named himself a namestnik. The Statute, signed by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, replaced the personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Russian Empire with the ‘eternal incorporation’ of Poland into Russia. The Parliament of the Kingdom was abolished, and its army merged with the Russian Army. \n §RNOTE: Congress Poland is an extremely hard to play substate. You won’t get any soldiers and when the Polish Uprising begins you will probably lose the game.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA500000;When will the Poles be free?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500001;After the latest war our subjects in Poland and other parts of our empire began to grow restless. The uprising began as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Army. It was soon joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and various politicians. In Warsaw alone 116 demonstrations were held in $YEAR$. Much of these manifestations in ended in clashes with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Army. In spite of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police interference, a symbolic meeting of hymn-singing Poles and Lithuanians took place on the bridge across an important River. The crowds sang ‘God protect Poland’ in Lithuanian and Belarusian. Earlier in $YEAR$ the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government introduced a state of emergency in Kovno and Grodno as well as several other Polish-majority provinces. Public gatherings were banned and some public leaders were declared outlaws. The situation threatens to break down in anarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC500006;After the Revolution in Berlin succeeded during the Spring of Nations, newly freed Polish prisoners joined the Berlin Home Guard by founding a “Polish Legion”, and were armed with weapons from the Prussian Arsenal. A Pole waved the black, red, and gold flag of the German Revolution and the prisoners were celebrated by the public. Speeches were made about a joint fight against the Russians for a free and united Germany and an independent Poland. Many were under the impression that all of Prussia wanted a free Poland to serve as a shield against Russia and that the Polish question would soon be resolved. However, after a while, the atmosphere among the Germans and a portion of the Jewish population began to change dramatically at the first signs of violence by the Poles. In a matter of days revolutionary sentiment had risen throughout the entire Duchy of Posen. Polish nobility and peasantry took up arms, preparing for a confrontation with the Prussian Army, Prussian symbols were torn down, and in couple of places fighting erupted against German colonists. The revolt had begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC500114;20 years ago, our Empire rightfully claimed vast territories in Northwestern Pacific America. Various loyal servants of the Empire, explorers and merchants such as the famed Baranov and Rezanov, were keen on the idea of planting the Russian Imperial flag on as much of the Pacific as possible. They established several key trading posts in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and other islands. However, despite their successess, support from the central government was usually low, owing it to a cautious attitude of distant St. Petersburg, and even more cautious Tsar Paul. Tsar Aleksandr I curtailed Russian expansion in the area even further, concluding Russo-American Treaty of 1824 and Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825, giving up our claims south of the 54th parallel. Maybe that was a mistake. Whispers in the government are again talking about opportunities in sparsely settled Pacifican coast. Some say we should have listened to Mordvinov about California. Some say Nesselrode was right, it is a waste of resources and time. Whatever the Emperor decides, the Empire will follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Of total Tatar population 300,000 of the Taurida Governorate about 200,000 Crimean Tatars emigrated to the Ottoman Empire.

England threatens Greece to support the false claims of a miserable Jew and burns its fleet: that is a lawful action - but Russia demands a treaty to protect millions of Christians, and that is deemed to strengthen its position in the East at the expense of the balance of power.

Western powers were forced to acknowledge Russian Supremacy in the territory of the Ottoman Empire and recognize expanded stipulations of Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca from 1774, and confirmed her status as Protector of all the Christians within the Empire. Russia has concluded peace with Western Allies in the Treaty of Paris, however, an Ottoman delegation was not invited to these negotiations, further worsening their position as Russia is now free to impose any demands they wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME500133;Treaty of Ayvansaray;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500133;The Treaty of Ayvansaray of $YEAR$ was shockingly sobering for the Ottoman Administration. If anyone had any doubts whether the Man on the Bosphorus is truly sick, they have no such qualms anymore. The Ottoman Empire has been forced to agree on unconditional military access of Russian forces, had to agree on a 3-year occupation of its lands (pending fullfilment of all terms), pay war indemnities, and close the Bosphorus for any warships not bearing the Russian Flag. While many in Europe expected the Russian Tsar to annex vast amounts of lands in the Balkans and Anatolia, our court had no such aspirations. The difficulty of administering vast, newly acquired troublesome lands, being unfamiliar with local politics, ethnoreligious squabbles that are sure to arise, Russia has decided to embark on a more pragmatic path. While nominally dependent and retained under Ottoman suzerainty, several regions were to be given wide regional autonomy, administed by local Christians with oversight from the Porte, and Russian final saying on appointment of governors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In the East, they annexed the region of Kars, as well as eastern parts of Pontus, westwards up to the ancient city of Trebizond. In the Armenian Plateau, Ottomans were forced to make immediate reforms, under ever-watchful eyes of the Russian Imperial troops, where 6 vilayets with Armenian majority have been merged into an autonomous region under the protection of Russia. In the Balkans, a nominally independent Principality of (Eastern) Bulgaria was formed, while former vilayets of Bosnia and Macedonia have been enlarged, granted autonomy and given over to local Christian elite to govern, under Russian protection. Finally, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro have been formally recognized as independent states, while the latter two, as well as Greece, received several land concessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC500136;In 1845, in St Petersburg, Count Nikolay Semyonovich Mordvinov died at the age of 90. He was one of the most reputable Russian political thinkers of Alexander I's reign. He is associated with the reforms of Mikhail Speransky, and has in intervals served in the Navy and the Cabinet under several Tsars, with the rank of Admiral. He became particularly popular with young liberals, who admired his courage to oppose the government when needed. Both Ryleev and Pushkin dedicated enthusiastic poems to him. He considered serfdom to be the main obstacle to the successful economic development of Russia, and wrote that "Freedom, property, enlightenment and justice are the main and only origins of wealth". He also advocated free enterprise, principles of private property and, like Vorontsov, defended a protectionist customs tariff. He was constantly rebuffed by the Absolutist Government, until his experiment of settling freed serfs in California was approved and showed success.

Although nominally still under Ottoman control, this province is essentially a Russian puppet, governed by local Christian Serbs. Protests by the majority of the population yearning for unification with Serbia have intensified, and in some areas, agitation for unification has devolved into violent guerrilla warfare. While the Panslavic idea of unity of all South Slavs is widespread, not all Muslim and Catholic residents want to become part of Serbia. Factions within the Principality of Serbia actively support nationalist elements in this region, which exacerbates tensions. The problem is bigger than domestic strife. Austria has made it clear that it will not tolerate further Slavic state enlargements in the Balkans, and has specifically singled out Bosnia as a region not to be admitted into Serbia, fearing panslavist threats within their own country and further Yugoslav claims that could inflame the situation.

EVTDESC500160;In 1908, the Bosnian Annexation Crisis, also known as the Bosnian Crisis, broke out between Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Serbia. The conflict originated with the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, which was seen as a threat to Serbia's ambitions to unify all the South Slavic peoples of the Balkans under its rule. The annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was met with strong protests from Serbia and Bulgaria, as well as from the other South Slavic nations of the Balkans. The crisis escalated rapidly and almost led to war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia when the Austro-Hungarian government threatened to send troops to the region. The international community, led by the Russian Empire, eventually managed to diffuse the situation and maintain the peace. Nevertheless, the crisis brought Austria-Hungary and Serbia to the brink of war and left a lasting mark on the already fragile political relations between them. How should we react?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA500160;Outrageous! Mobilize the Army and ask the Russians for support!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB500160;Back down. We can not hope to challenge Austria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500161;Believing the opportunity to seize Bosnia was favourable, K. u. K. Monarchie Österreich-Ungarn has decided to formally annex the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a nominally Ottoman autonomous province, which the Austrians were given protectorate over in the aftermath of the Congres of Berlin, in 1878. $FROMCOUNTRY$ and Knjaževina Crna Gora have preventively mobilized their troops, and send urgent appeals to our Imperial Court and the Tsar to not allow this blatant Germanic enroachment in the Balkans to stand. Dubbed as the Bosnian Crisis, it has thrown the diplomatic circles of Europe into chaos, and quite possibly, a into a confrontation between Great Powers, in a magnitude that has never been seen before. Our allies call for action and help! Our military attache in Belgrad reported late last night that the region is on the verge of outright military confrontation. While we have turned a blind eye to Austrian affairs in Bosnia so far, in according with Reichstadt, they may have gone too far. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME500162;Bosnian Vilayet Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500162;Russia reacted in outrage to the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia in 1908. They saw the move as a breach of the Treaty of Berlin, which had been signed in 1878 and established Bosnian independence. Russia accused Austria-Hungary of attempting to expand their influence and destabilize the balance of power in the Balkans. The Russian government issued a statement condemning the annexation and called for the international community to take action to prevent it from happening. They also took steps to increase pressure on Austria-Hungary by mobilizing troops on the Russo-Austrian border and threatening military action if their demands were not met. At the same time, Russia also sought to rally international support for their cause and increase diplomatic pressure on Austria-Hungary. In particular, they reached out to Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria, who were also threatened by the Austro-Hungarian move. Ultimately, we have not been able to garner enough support for a military reaction, and now our allies are instructing us to pursue a diplomatic approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As if its theirs to give away!.. or that we should have to ask! We are merely taking what is legally ours. Who cares what the people of Bosnia think about that? Now, the Russian minions in the Balkans have began making noise and ask Russia for support, which has swooped the Courts of Europe, attempting to curry support. Not just that, but as of today, they have given us, nothing less than an ultimatum! After formally handing in the thinly veiled telegram whose gist was "Leave or measures will be taken", supposedly, words have been uttered. Before departing the capital, the Russian Ambassador in Vienna, approached our Minister with a stern, cold look, and told him in a thick, Slavic accent: "Verlassen sie Bosnien... oder Krieg".. Impudent whelps!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC500165;The courier has finally reached the Tsar. At the luxurious imperial retreat, the famed Livadia Palace on the Crimean peninsula, the Tsar was found sitting on a rocking chair on his seaside terrace, gazing at the sunset over the Black Sea. He read the telegram. It said: Avstriya. /stop/ otkazyvayetsya. /stop/ ul'timatuma. /stop/ He sat there, silently, calm as a cup of water, as if the faith of the world was not in his hands. "Franz refuses the ultimatum. What now?" He asked, looking back at the courier. "How happy, huh? To be a servant. To have no will. To make no decisions. Driftwood. How very restful it must all be.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC500176;Our dominant influence in the affairs of the Ottoman Empire has not been disputed since the victory in the Crimean War. While what was left of Ottoman Empire was frail and weak, the authority of the Ottoman Caliph has remained somewhat steady within Muslim-majority provinces of the Empire. We've been influencing and deciding what happens within actual and nominal territories of the Empire, on one hand, through our Christian allies and client states, and Ottoman Porte from another. The Empire is now going off at the seams though, and as witnessed, violence between Christians and Muslims is at its height. We must undoubtebly intervene and put this sick man to its final rest. However, playing realpolitik with various factions within a broken state may have worked so far, but if we were to dismantle this Empire, it will be a completely different affair. Great Powers of Europe will oppose it strongly and unite against us, unless we were to call a pre-emptive Conference and allow others to have a piece of the cake too.

EVTDESC500188;The Russian Empire now fully controls the Black Sea, and many territories beyond it. As our borders expand southwards ever further, so too does the focus shift away from the North and our old capital in St Petersburg. While Tsar Peter's idea was grand, and served Russia well in circumstances it found itself, building a grand new city on the banks of the Baltic Sea and finally establishing firm trading connections with the West, our Baltic ports are only good enough for a little more than 6 months per year, as over winter, they freeze and commerce stops. Ever more, our shipping companies trade through our southern warm ports, such as Odessa and Sevastopol, and from recently, Constantinople. As the focus of the industry shifts southwards towards the Donetskiy ugolny basseyn, the infrastructure around it, the ports on the Black Sea, railways we are building all over the South and its burgeoning industry, perhaps the center of administration and utmost authority should follow this trend too.

EVTNAME500190;Ultimatum for Manchuria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500190;The Russian Empire established a strong presence in Manchuria in the late 19th century, primarily through the Trans-Siberian Railway. This allowed Russia to become a regional power in the region, with Russian traders and settlers flocking to the area. Russian troops were also sent to quell Chinese revolts. While their Army has been present here since they built the Manchurian Railway, they were supposed to leave at some point. Now we see why they have not, and Russia has issued us ultimatum to give up Manchuria, or else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As our standing and influences in the international community grows, we can now demand the masters of the Gambia to hand over their Gambian colony on the basis of the first ownership act. Our control of Courland-Semigallia allows us to lay claims on it. And if they do not hand it back, we would have a very valid casus belli against them.

EVTDESC500231;The emperor went to the Mikhailovsky Manège, as he had done every Sunday for many years. He rode in a closed carriage to and from the Manège, accompanied by six Cossacks and Frank Joseph Jackowski. The usual route was along the Catherine Canal and over the Pevchesky Bridge. Nikolai Rysakov, a young member of the Narodnaya Volya, the "People's Will" movement, was carrying a small white package wrapped in a handkerchief. He threw it beneath the Tsar's carriage. The explosion, which killed one of the Cossacks and seriously injured the driver and people on the sidewalk, only damaged the bulletproof carriage, a gift from Napoleon III of France. The emperor emerged shaken but unharmed. Rysakov was apprehended almost immediately. Dvorzhitzky offered to drive the Tsar back to the Palace in his sleigh. The Tsar agreed, but first he wanted to see the perpetrator and assess the damage. He expressed concern for the victims. "Thank God, I'm untouched," Alexander replied to his entourage's anxious questions. A shout is heard from the crowd:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I jumped up and rushed to the emperor, gathering all of my strength. His Majesty was resting on his right arm, half-lying, half-sitting. I tried to carry him, thinking he was just badly injured, but the czar's legs were fractured and blood flowed out of them. Twenty persons lay on the sidewalk and in the street with varied degrees of injury. Some were able to rise, some were able to crawl, while yet others attempted to escape from beneath bodies that had fallen on them." - Prince Dvorzhitzky. Alexander was brought by sleigh to the Winter Palace to his study, where he had signed the Emancipation Edict liberating the serfs almost exactly twenty years before. Alexander was bleeding to death, his legs had been severed, his stomach had been ripped open, and his face had been mangled. The Romanov family members rushed to the site.

EVTDESC500233;Following failed efforts to assassinate him, derail his train, and finally blow up the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg itself, Alexander, who had demonstrated unyielding courage under personal attack based on a fatalist philosophy, entrusted Count Mikhail Loris-Melikov, the Minister of the Interior, with the task of eliminating the terrorist organization (dubbed People's Will) but also appeasing moderate opinion, which had become alienated by the repressive policies pursued since 1866. Melikov proposed economical and institutional reforms to quell unrest and reform the State. Among these was a modest step towards Constitutionalism in Russia, which was the project of having representatives of the people, albeit unelective, participating in legislative branch of the government. The Tsar's Ukaz forming several Commissions has now been published along with the Melikov draft.

However, when his brother Alexander passed childless, and his brother Constantine disinherited himself having a wife of lower standing rather than the throne, Nicholas heeded the duty's call. The unrest and danger of his first days in 1825 left a deep mark on Nicholas' character and would follow him throughout his reign. Nicholas I came to represent autocracy personified: infinitely majestic, determined and powerful, hard as stone, and relentless as fate. In everyday affairs, he was very demanding of his family, the court, and all who were in civil service, and he put a high priority on order and obedience.

EVTNAME500238;Russia in 1836;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500238;The emperor loved everything Russian, and insisted on Russian language and manners at court (until then, French, and sometimes German, was spoken). Despite the rather harsh political regime, literature and art flourished. This was the era during which the poets Pushkin and Lermontov worked, when Zhukovsky brilliantly translated foreign poetry, when Mikhail Glinka composed the first Russian operas, and Karl Bryullev and Alexander Ivanov painted their masterpieces. Nicholas lead Russia successfully through wars with Qajar Persia (1826-1829), Ottomans (1828-1829), further pursued conquest of the Caucasus, and navigated European Concert of Europe fairly well as a true Gendarme of Europe. He embraced the official policy of the state as Orthodoxy, Autocracy, Nationality, which marked Russia for many decades to come. Industrial Revolution eventually reached Russia's doorstep, however, it lagged behind its major contemporaries in the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME500237;Tsar Nicholas I Dies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500237;During the Crimean War, Nicholas died on March 2, 1855, at the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. He developed a chill, refused medical treatment, and died of pneumonia, amid rumors that he was committing passive suicide by refusing treatment. He was laid to rest in St. Petersburg's Peter and Paul Cathedral. He ruled for 30 years before being succeeded by his son, Alexander II. Alexander II has revealed to be more similar to late Emperor Alexander I, than his passing father. Still autocratic, but progressive in comparison, Alexander pursued administrative, institutional and military reforms that modernized Russia and opened it to the world. Alexandar would go on to liberate 23 million serfs in the groundbreaking Emancipation of 1861, as well as plethora of other reforms that followed in the 1860's towards an independent judiciary system, military and education improvements. After attempts on his life in late 1860s, Alexander was more cautious towards further reform, and some were rolled back, however, by the end of his reign, he was open to resuming the path towards Constitutionalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC500239;To avoid player confusion or repetitive questions on discord on how to achieve XYZ, and considering @RUS rework in our mod is expansive and differs sometimes in design policy than what you would usually expect from a V2 campaign, I've decided to write this introductory handbook for the player.

EVTDESC500240;As far as internals go, emperors up to and including Alexander III have been added, as well as flavour regarding their reigns. You start as Nicholas, with Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality steering the wheel. Reforms are blocked (barring a revolution), and the reign is focused on centralizing the empire and expanding its borders. Gendarme of Europe modifier allows you to justify wars on revolutionaries (republics). Alexander's succession removes aforementioned restrictions and his reign is focused on reforms. Abolishing the serfdom and further reforms are no longer tied to the Crimean War, but his reign. Earliest you can start them will be 1856. Further, manual reforms will be unlocked from the start of his reign. In the 1860s, there will be reactionary pushback to reforms and reaction will try to get you to backpeddal some of it. In the late 1870s, there will be events about his assassination. Read them well. One path leads to Absolutism (Alexander III historical), the other towards a Constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA500240;Go Back;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500241;As a small warning, 1848 @POL Uprising could engulf your @CPL partition in that year, instead 1863. Crimean War has been entirely revamped, with you almost always facing at least 3 opponents: @ENG, @FRA and @SAR. @AUS has 4 paths they can choose from, from allying you to joining the coalition against you. Prussia will react to either of Austrian extreme paths. There is also a decision in Options to increase the chance @AUS and @PRU join in. The war goal is scripted as it was before, so you only have to win the starting CB and you will have won the war. If you win it, the outcome is entirely redone. Just to say, @RUS attitude towards various regions of @TUR has been thoroughly researched, and the alternative Treaty of Ayvansaray (Fatih district) is based on Constantinople Conference of 1876-7, San Stefano Treaty, as well as 1774, 1829 and so forth treaties, and general @RUS policy towards Balkans, Anatolia, and Armenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500284;There will be several nascent Balkan entities under your care if you win in Crimean War - but do not assume the work is done. There are many outlying issues that will pop up over the years that will require your decision and intervention. @TUR Porte will be subservient... or will it? Read the events carefully, as your choice will have impact on the outcome and just how deep your claws will sink into this region. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500242;Great Eastern Crisis has been redone entirely, in the case @RUS wins in 1853. This event will now truly be about dismantlement of @TUR Empire, which is almost certain - the question remains how, whether you will keep the peace in Europe by letting other Great Powers take (to you, distant areas), or will you try to go solo, and take it all for yourself? Think wisely before you engage in maximalism, as you will have entirety of Europe facing you down. It also will tie into what happened between the two wars, and you will be deciding faith of @ARM, Eastern @YUG, Anatolia, and so forth. As with the previous war, this one's outcome is scripted so there is no need for additional wargoals to add. Great Game has been reverted to how it worked in HFM for now, I didn't like the way I made it so its just HFM-default now. Similar to those event chain(s) in Balkans post-Crimea, will after GEC happen in Anatolia and the Middle East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500243;Early on, there's gonna be an event on your stance on Pacific, North America to be precise. Tip: California, Oregon and a future dominion potential. You have to act quickly on it, follow the decision and event chain, otherwise @ENG or @USA will beat you to the punch. @QNG Rudimentary chain about Japanese-Russian Rivalry in Korea and Manchuria as well as a way to directly annex Manchuria and cause war(s) with Japan. As I had no more space in internals, I would just like to add that depending what you choose will impact your ability to (and whether you can at all) improve your Empire. Example: Donbass and Dnieper Basin industrializations. Panslavism: Possibility to accept other cultures with Mass Politics and Const. Monarchy (or republic) in late game. There's probably a lot I forgot to mention, but to reveal all would just spoil the campaign, so enjoy it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC500253;In 1853, the Austrian Empire sought to expand its territory by annexing the Danubian Principalities. The principalities had been under the Ottoman Empire rule since 1683 and were the disputed possessions of both the Russians and Ottomans. Austria sought to gain control of the territories in order to expand its influence in the region, assert its dominance over the Ottoman Empire, and gain access to the important Danube River trading route. To achieve this goal, Austria sent troops into Wallachia and Moldavia during the Crimean War, on the pretension of protecting themselves from Russia. Despite initially having the support of other European powers, Austria was ultimately unsuccessful in its mission, and it was forced to withdraw. Danubian Principalities were put under joint Great Power Stewardship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The German diet has called for the Munchen Congress to discuss the formation of a unified German state. The capital was decided to be same city where the Congress was held. Munich served not only as a strategic capital due to its distance from Russia, but also secured against other potential threats to the new German state. \n \n The goal of this new German Confederation is clear: to liberate all oppressed Germans from foreign rule, the die has been cast in Europe for great and terrible war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME500285;Reactionaries Agitate to end Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500285;Alexander II's reforms in Russia lasted from 1861-1881, and in those two decades, he implemented sweeping changes to the country's social, judicial, and political institutions. This period was known as the Great Reforms and saw the emancipation of serfs, the introduction of universal military conscription, the creation of elected local councils and a professional civil service, and the introduction of trial by jury. Many of the reforms were progressive and had a lasting impact on Russian society. Despite this, a majority of the population still suffered from severe poverty, and the reforms were often seen as inadequate by those who had to endure them. To make the things worse, now the aristocrats and reactionaries are agitating that we stop reforming and that the Tsar is on the wrong path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME500286;A Shot at Our Tsar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500286;On April 4th, 1866, Emperor Alexander II was exiting the northern gate of the Summer Garden in St. Petersburg, while on a walk. A small crowd of passers-by spontaneously gathered at a respectful distance to see the Emperor walk towards his carriage. And from this crowd, a shot was fired by a 26-year-old Dmitry Karakozov. Luckily, Osip Komissarov, a 28-year-old peasant who worked as a hatmaker's apprentice, was also at the scene, and ended up saving the Emperor. “I saw this man hurrying through the crowd,” Komissarov remembered. “I could not help watching him. Suddenly, I see that he has taken out his pistol and is aiming it.” The Emperor paused near his carriage to put on his coat, and that’s when Komissarov hit Karakozov’s hand, so the shot went in the air. This was witnessed by General E. Totleben, who was present in the crowd and confirmed Komissarov's heroism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA500286;That man is a Hero! Invite him to the Winter Palace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME500287;The Aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500287;“I felt sad and sore, because my people were dying, and so I decided to destroy the evil Tsar and die for my dear people myself,” a proclamation found in the pocket of the shooter, Dmitry Karakozov, read. As he was caught by the crowd, the Emperor asked him: “Why did you try to shoot me?” “You fooled your people – you promised them land, but didn’t give it to them,” Karakozov replied, referring to the abolition of serfdom that happened in 1861, whereupon the peasants had then to buy out their lands from the state. Karakozov turned out to be a member of a terrorist circle, and planned to start a revolution with his murder. Karakozov was put on trial and executed later in September 1866, while the Tsar’s savior, Osip Komissarov, was granted hereditary nobility. The very evening of the day he saved the Emperor, Komissarov was honored at the Winter Palace, hugged and greeted by Alexander II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA500287;I fooled my people... h-have I? Is he right?.. Have I betrayed my promise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME500289;Educational Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500289;In the 1860s, Tsar Alexander II of Russia implemented a series of educational reforms in order to modernize the Russian Empire. The reforms included the establishment of universities and secondary schools, the introduction of an education tax, the introduction of a national curriculum, and the reorganization of the Ministry of Education. These reforms significantly improved the quality of education in the Russian Empire and were an important factor in its modernization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600000;The February Revolution of 1917 was the first of two revolutions in Russia in 1917. Centred on the then capital Petrograd (modern day St. Petersburg) in March (late February in the Julian calendar). This revolution appeared to break out spontaneously, without any real leadership or formal planning. Russia had been suffering from a number of economic and social problems, which were compounded by the impact of World War I. Bread rioters and industrial strikers were joined on the streets by disaffected soldiers from the city’s garrison. As more and more troops deserted, and with loyal troops away at the Front, the city fell into a state of chaos, leading…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600001;Lenin arrived in Petrograd on April 16, 1917, one month after the Tsar had been forced to abdicate. On his return to Russia, Lenin electrified his own comrades, most of whom accepted the authority of the Provisional Government. Lenin called this government, despite its democratic pretensions, thoroughly imperialist and undeserving of support by Socialists. It was incapable of satisfying the most profound desires of the workers, soldiers, and peasants for immediate peace and division of landed estates among the peasants. Only a soviet government-that is, direct rule by workers, soldiers, and peasants-could fulfil these demands. Therefore, he raised the battle cry, ‘All power to the Soviets!’. He began publishing papers and stirring up the communists and socialists! What should the provisional government do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The telegram contained the statement that the Provisional Government would continue the war with the Tsarist war aims.

Lenin went into hiding, while other leaders were arrested. The outcome of the July Days represented a temporary decline in the growth of Bolshevik power and influence in the period before the October Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600004;The Kornilov Affair, was an (alleged) attempted coup d’état by the then Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, General Lavr Kornilov, in August 1917 against the Russian Provisional Government headed by Alexander Kerensky. Kerensky, hearing of a possible coup attempt by Kornilov, questioned him and interpreted his responses as a confirmation of his intention to seize power by force. In response, Kerensky dismissed Kornilov from his position. When the telegram to dismiss Kornilov arrived, he believed that Kerensky was acting under intense pressure from the Soviets and consequently the Bolsheviks, therefore he ordered the Third Cavalry Corps to move swiftly to Petrograd to put down what he assumed to be a Bolshevik uprising. The coup failed and Kornilov was incarcerated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600005;The October Revolution of 1917 was led by the Bolsheviks, specifically by Lenin, who used their influence in the Petrograd Soviet to organize the armed forces. Bolshevik Red Guards forces under the Military Revolutionary Committee began the takeover of government buildings on 24 October 1917 (O.S.). The following day, the Winter Palace (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia), was captured. The October revolution ended the phase of the revolution instigated in February, replacing Russia’s short-lived provisional parliamentary government with government by soviets, local councils elected by bodies of workers and peasants. Liberal and monarchist forces, loosely organized into the White Army, immediately went to war against the Bolsheviks Red Army, in a series of battles that would become known as the Russian Civil War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600006;The Communists have finally fallen out of power in the motherland. The ‘Soviet Union’ no longer exists. Only Russia, one and indivisible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600007;We are no longer only Russia, but rather the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics! Russia no longer exists, so neither should its claims on our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600008;The Russian Civil War (25 October 1917—October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire fought between the Bolshevik Red Army and the White Army, the loosely allied anti-Bolshevik forces. Many foreign armies warred against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in the Crimea and were evacuated in the autumn of 1920. A number of independent countries—Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland—emerged from the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600009;The civil war has finally ended. The Russian economy was devastated by the war, with factories and bridges destroyed, cattle and raw materials pillaged, mines flooded, and machines damaged. The industrial production value descended to one seventh of the value of 1913, and agriculture to one third. War Communism saved the Soviet government during the Civil War, but much of the Russian economy had ground to a standstill. But now our motherland can finally rebuild itself, in peace, free of the capitalism oppression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600010;Tsarists and imperialists in Russia are waging a war of aggression against the proletariat! Should we intervene?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600011;Socialists and communists in Russia are warring against the rightful government in an attempt to claim legitimacy! Should we intervene?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600012;Around the country, in the midst of the continuing revolution, people’s soviets have been established, forming socialist and communist local governments. They claim legitimacy, but we are working to remove them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600013;Despite our best efforts to consolidate power and maintain order, the soviets have broken off, and are waging war against us for the legitimate right to rule Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600014;The war has finally ended. Now our motherland can finally rebuild itself, in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600015;It has been a long, harsh revolution. Socialists, reactionaries, and communists alike have tried to oust the rightful Liberal Provisional Government from power, but we managed to maintain control and power! Now that the country has calmed down, we can begin reforming our government properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600016;After the coup by the reactionary officers, our military junta has finally managed to consolidate power in Russia. What shall our next actions be in shaping the Motherland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600017;The Bolsheviks have been in control of the Provisional Government long enough to mould Russia to their ideal. We are now a nation lead by the Proletariat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600018;The Third International or The Communist International, was an association of national communist parties founded in 1919 by Lenin. Though its stated purpose was the promotion of world revolution, the Comintern functioned chiefly as an organ of Soviet control over the international communist movement. The Comintern emerged from the three-way split in the socialist Second International. A majority of socialist parties, comprising the International’s ‘right’ wing, chose to support the war efforts of their respective national governments against exterior enemies. The ‘centre’ faction of the International decried the nationalism of the right and sought the reunification of the Second International under the banner of world peace. The ‘left’ group, led by Vladimir Lenin, rejected both nationalism and pacifism, urging instead a socialist drive to transform the war of nations into a transnational class war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600019;In November 1917, following the October Revolution, the first government of the independent Transcaucasia was created in Tbilisi. The Transcaucasian Commissariat (Sejm) existed for a couple of months following the Bolshevik seizure of power. Later, the Sejm proclaimed the ‘Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic’ and a peace conference was held between the Ottoman Empire and a delegation of the Sejm. The mood prevailing in Tbilisi was very different. Tbilisi acknowledged a state of war between itself and the Ottoman Empire. A new peace conference opened at Batum and at this conference the Ottomans extended their demands. The Armenian and Georgian members of the Republic’s delegation began to stall. Beginning on May 21, the Ottoman army moved ahead once again. The conflict led to a series of battles and on May 26, 1918, Georgia declared independence;two days later, Armenia and Azerbaijan followed suit, dissolving the federation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600020;With the Bolshevik taking the power in Russia, they are pressuring us to change our government to be more aligned with theirs! They demand a proletariat government in our country! What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600021;The October Revolution of 1917 turned Finnish politics upside down. Now, the new non-Socialist majority of the Parliament desired total independence, and the Socialists came gradually to view Soviet Russia as an example to follow. On November 15, 1917, the Bolsheviks declared a general right of self-determination, including the right of complete secession, ‘for the Peoples of Russia’. On the same day the Finnish Parliament issued a declaration by which it temporarily took power in Finland. Worried by the development in Russia, and Finland, the non-Socialist Senate proposed that Parliament declare Finland’s independence, which was agreed on in the Parliament on December 6, 1917. On December 18 the Soviet government issued a Decree, recognizing Finland’s independence, and on December 22 it was approved by the highest Soviet executive body—VTsIK. Germany and the Scandinavian countries followed without delay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600022;Historically, with the outbreak of the World War I, the Russian Empire fell into revolution and civil war. As a part of this larger conflict, the Estonians declared independence from Russia and won their freedom during the Estonian War of Independence. As a symbol of Estonian independence, Yuryev/Dorpat was officially given back its Estonian name, Tartu. The new Communist Russian government acknowledged Estonia’s freedom in the 1920 Treaty of Tartu. The Estonians are offering us a peace treaty, what should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600023;Historically, after the Russian Empire lost the Crimean war and was weakened economically and politically, an unrest started in the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In Vilnius alone 116 demonstrations were held in 1861. In August 1861, manifestations in Vilnius ended in clashes with the Imperial Russian Army. In spite of Russian police and Cossack interference, a symbolic meeting of hymn-singing Poles and Lithuanians took place on the bridge across Niemen River. After a series of patriotic riots, the Russian Namestnik of Tsar Alexander II, General Karl Lambert, introduced martial law in Poland on 14 October 1861. Public gatherings were banned and some public leaders made outlaws. Now, with the hardships of the Crimean War, the poles, the Lithuanians and the Ukrainians are rising to make patriotic demonstrations. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600024;The January Uprising was an uprising in the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (present-day Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, parts of Ukraine, western Russia) against the Russian Empire. It began on 22 January 1863 and lasted until the last insurgents were captured in 1865. The uprising began as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Imperial Russian Army, and was soon joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and various politicians. The rebels set up a provisional government in Congress Poland and are stirring other poles, Ukrainians and Lithuanians to rise against us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600025;The Polish demonstrations have grown into a mass rebellion! Lithuanians and Latvians joined the poles and seceded from Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600050;When a Polish insurrection broke out in Galicia (Austrian Poland) early in 1846, Austria held that Cracow’s independent status provided the stimulus as well as a forum for the planning of Polish revolts and obtained the consent of Russia and Prussia to suppress the Republic of Cracow. After a brief resistance, Cracow was occupied by Austrian troops (March 1846) and attached to Galicia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600051;The Kraków Uprising of February 1846 was an attempt, led by Edward Dembowski, to incite a Polish fight for national independence. Most of the uprising was limited to the Free City of Kraków, where Jagiellonian University philosophy professor Michal Wiszniewski acted as its chief for a day, to be followed by Rector Jan Tyssowski. Teofil Wisniowski, the President of the Uprising Tribunal in the Austrian province of Galizien, led a short-lived uprising in Eastern Galicia, which saw a battle at Narajów involving Austrian hussars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB600051;Suppress the revolutionaries or the Austrians might retaliate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600052;A Polish revolution began on Kraków and it threatens to spread like wildfire in our great nation. Austria is asking our consent to suppress Kraków, arguing the free city is the focus of the Polish nationality and insurgency and that suppressing the city can end future Polish rebellions. Our diplomats are worried that this rebellion may grow if we don’t support the Austrians. What do we tell the Austrian envoy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME600052;The Polish Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600057;Colorado Rebels took the government and forced president Oribe to step down. Fructuoso Rivera, once exiled in Brazil, returned and now assumes the country as interim president until the next election. Manuel Oribe, the former Blanco President, was forced to flee the country in exile to Buenos Aires. Rivera dissolved the parliament, called for an election and installed pro-Colorado politicians in the upper house while the Colorado Caudillos are laying down their arms and donating what they can to help the Colorado government. France and the United Kingdom, seeking the downfall of Rosas, are also sending help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600058;President Manuel Oribe from Uruguay was deposed by the Colorado Party and fled the country to Buenos Aires. Governor of Buenos Aires and president of the Argentine Confederation, Juan Manuel de Rosas, received him as the constitutional president and soon offered him the command of the armies of the Argentine Confederation. Rivera, the interim president of Uruguay and leader of the Colorados, is extremely hostile to Rosas and to the Confederation thanks to the fact that Rosas and other Federalist Argentines backed Oribe in the past as well due to ideological differences. Rivera now harbour Argentine exiles that might cause problems in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600059;The political scene in Uruguay during the 1830s became split between two parties, the conservative Blancos (‘Whites’) and the liberal Colorados (literally ‘coloureds’, more usually ‘Reds’). The Colorados were led by Fructuoso Rivera and represented the business interests of Montevideo. The Blancos were headed by Manuel Oribe, who looked after the agricultural interests of the countryside and promoted protectionism. The two groups took their names from the colour of the armbands that they wore. Initially, the Colorados wore blue, but when it faded in the sun, they replaced it with red. \n \n The Uruguayan Constitution of 1830 didn’t anticipate the sharing of political power between parties, which forced the minorities to resort to revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600061;For a long time, two projects of country divided Argentina. Unitarianists or Unitarians were the proponents of the concept of a Unitary state (centralized government) in Buenos Aires and they were led by Juan Lavalle. They were opposed to the Argentine Federalists, who wanted a federation of independent provinces, led by Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Unitarians, sympathetic to our government, fled Argentina in exile after being defeated in 1831. Rosas, the so called Restorer of the Laws, controlled the Argentina Confederation for too long under his despotic rule. They harbour Oribe, who claims is still president, and their government is hostile to ours. Our most trusted Caudillos argue that it is time to prepare for war and for that end we can weaken the Confederation by using our Unitarianist friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In exchange for our help, they are proposing several benefits for our country, such as treaties for the free navigation of the Uruguay river, taxes and trade benefits, renouncement of their claims on the border with Rio Grande do Sul and the recognition of Brazil’s right to interfere with Uruguay internal affairs.

EVTDESC700000;Paraguayan supreme dictator, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, took several precautions against assassination. He would lock the Palace doors himself, unroll the cigars his sister made to ensure there was no poison, prepare his own yerba mate, and sleep with a pistol under his pillow. No one could come within six paces of him, or even bear a cane near him. Whenever he would go out riding, he had all bushes and trees along the route uprooted so that assassins could not hide. All shutters had to be closed, and pedestrians had to prostrate before him as he passed. Sensing his mortality, he destroyed all his papers and refused medical aid, even lashing out at a physician with his sabre. In this day, Francia breathed his last and passed away. Francia left the state treasury with at least twice as much money in it as when he took office, including 36,500 pesos of his unspent salary, the equivalent of several years’ salary.

The constitution not only legally sanctioned López’ dictatorial powers, but included no guarantees of civil rights. Indeed, the word ‘liberty’ was not even mentioned in the text.\n His government now is directing energy towards developing the material resources and strengthening the military power of the country.

EVTDESC700011;Dr José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia y Velasco is a Paraguayan lawyer and the dictator of Paraguay. Originally a professor of philosophy, he entered the cabildo of Asunción while working as a lawyer and rose to become the head of the cabildo. After the proclamation of the Paraguayan Republic he became an important political leader in South America, and was eventually installed as supreme leader before being declared dictator for life. \n Inspired by French revolutionary ideals, Francia sought to create a utopian state based on Rosseau’s Social Contract. Although he strived for equality of the people, Francia ruthlessly destroyed any opposition and created a Police state, imprisoning all those he deemed seditious. \n Francia lived a spartan lifestyle, and apart from some books and furniture, his only possessions were a tobacco case and a pewter confectionery box.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Solano López, born in the capital, was made Brigadier General of the Paraguayan Army by his father at the age of 18, in 1844, during the spasmodic hostilities then prevailing with Argentina. He was sent in 1853 as minister plenipotentiary to the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, and spent a year and a half in Europe. He purchased large quantities of arms and military supplies, together with several steamers, and organized a project for building a railroad and establishing a French colony in Paraguay. He also became infatuated with the empire of Napoleon III and with Napoleon Bonaparte himself. López equipped his army with exact copies of uniforms of Napoleonic army. He ordered for himself an exact replica of Napoleon’s crown. Returning to Paraguay, he became Minister of War in 1855 and was appointed as Vice President by his father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While mourned much like his father, Francisco left behind no legitimate children or any other protégé who would be the clear successor.

EVTDESC810003;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats along with representatives from the other Great Powers have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the question of the Danish straits and, more specifically, the Sound Dues. Citing the fact that the world’s seafaring nations are becoming less and less tolerant of these tolls and restrictions, they are lobbying for the abolition of the Dues and for the commitment that all Danish straits will be turned into international waterways free to all military and commercial shipping. In compensation for the abolition, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state will receive a one-time fee of 300,000¤. Though the convention is amicable, the Great Powers made clear that they are prepared to use force to open the straits, if it comes to that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After a positive resolution, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats are now trying to gather the remaining money to pay for the deal and they argue that our ships and our commerce in general stand posed to greatly benefit from the opening of the Danish straits. Based on this they argue that we should contribute to the indemnifications owed to the Danish straits’ controller. We are, of course, not bound by this—we can refuse, but doing so would not only hurt our image in the eyes of other countries, it would also anger $FROMCOUNTRY$: they would feel that we are indebted to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Within five months, eighteen disciples of the Skaykhi school had independently recognized him as a Manifestation of God. These eighteen disciples were later known as the Letters of the Living. In his early writings, Siyyid appears to identify himself as the gate (báb) to the Hidden Twelfth Imam and later he begins to explicitly proclaim his station as that of the Hidden Imam and a new messenger from God. After some time, preaching by the Letters of the Living led to opposition by the Islamic clergy, prompting the Governor of Shiraz to order the Báb’s arrest.

Both were taken to the courtyard of the barracks the next day where thousands of people had gathered to watch the execution. They were suspended on a wall in front of a large squad of Christian soldiers, the order was given to fire and the courtyard was filled with musket smoke. When it cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and Anís was unharmed: the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the ropes.

EVTDESC955186;With the Berlin Conference coming to an end and the great powers moving in Africa according to the principle of effective occupation, the creation of the Congo Free State became a reality and the $MONARCHTITLE$’s dominance over it was internationally recognized. The $MONARCHTITLE$ pledged to suppress the East African slave trade, promote humanitarian policies, guarantee free trade within the colony, impose no import duties for twenty years and to encourage philanthropic and scientific enterprises. Beginning in $YEAR$, however, the $MONARCHTITLE$ began to issue a series of decrees that violated these conditions. It was first decreed that the State asserted rights of proprietorship over all vacant lands throughout the Congo. Afterwards, the rights of the Congolese were reduced in their land to native villages and farms, making nearly all of the CFS crown lands. We can continue these policies which will lead to an eventual annexation, revert them or simply take control of the CFS, dealing with the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME955186;The Congo’s Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA955186;The Congo will be ruled as the $MONARCHTITLE$’s private property for our benefit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB955186;We don’t need to keep the facade anymore, annex the Congo. Deal with the natives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE955186;Onwards to Bakongo’s Congo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC955187;As the Congo is the private property of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$, we need to decide every three years how the country will be run for the next three years. Being too lenient and using it solely for philanthropic work might cement the country’s destiny as a civilizing experiment, forever barring it from being a colony. Pushing the natives to meet the production quotas, on the other hand, might lead to abuse that can give our opposition and the humanitarian organizations some ammunition against us. While that will not hinder any plans of colonizing the Congo, it will certainly affect our reputation in the eyes of the world. The optimal solution would be maintaining balance for long enough that the philanthropic excuse doesn’t collapse at the same time that our imperialistic plans for the Congo slowly become recognized and legitimized. Unfortunately for that, running the Congo is a costly affair and can easily leave us with debt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA955187;The Congolese WILL meet their production quotas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB955187;We don’t need to push them too hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC955187;A little philanthropic work never hurt anybody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC955188;The baskets of severed hands, set down at the feet of the European post commanders, became the symbol of the Congo Free State. The collection of hands became an end in itself. Soldiers brought them to the stations in place of rubber, they even went out to harvest them instead of rubber… They became a sort of currency. They came to be used to make up for shortfalls in rubber quotas, to replace… the people who were demanded for the forced labour gangs, and the soldiers were paid their bonuses on the basis of how many hands they collected.’ The mass-deaths in the CFS became a cause célèbre in $YEAR$. The Congo reform movement led a vigorous international movement against the maltreatment of the Congolese population. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ offered to reform his regime, but international opinion supported an end to the $MONARCHTITLE$’s rule and finally, yielding to international pressure, the Upper House of $COUNTRY$ annexed the Congo Free State in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC955189;In direct violation of his promises of free trade within the CFS under the terms of the Congo Treaty, not only had the State become a commercial entity directly or indirectly trading within its dominion, but also the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ had been slowly monopolizing a considerable amount of the ivory and rubber trade by imposing export duties on the resources traded by other merchants within the CFS. Despite all that, improvements in the Congo had been made and there was no over exploitation of the natives. Running the risk of corporations causing a humanitarian disaster because of over exploitation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ upper house decided, in a move coordinated and approved by other Great Power, to remove the $MONARCHTITLE$ as the sole personal ruler of the Congo and put it under control of $COUNTRY$ with all the legal institutions and guarantees that came with it. The corporations and the $MONARCHTITLE$ will be thoroughly compensated for the change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA955189;A new era begins for the Congo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC955190;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ kept his word and the Congo was ran as a philanthropic and humanitarian endeavour. He drove the slavers from the Congo basin, helped the natives modernize and civilize, he kept the Congo open for trade with all the nations. A few abuses were reported here and there, but this was usually passed as corruption or power abuse. The $MONARCHTITLE$ was never involved or held liable for those. This situation, however, led to the Great Powers closely watching the Congo and an international recognition of the Congo right to exist. This means that colonizing the Congo is a path that we can no longer trail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME955190;Civilizing Congo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA955190;Our work in the Congo is almost done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC955191;With the end of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy, the fate of the Congo as the old king private possession is now uncertain. There are several bills in the Upper House about its destiny, from annexation as a colony to letting them be free. The Great Powers are not sure how to proceed as the Conference recognized the old monarch as the ruler of the Congo but our close ties and already de facto administration of it gave us a prime position in deciding its fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC955200;As part of our African colonies Luhonono, as the natives call a small strip of land north of Tswana territory, would be of vital importance for our access to the heart of Africa.

EVTDESC955202;A dispute arose with $FROMCOUNTRY$ over our colonial borders in Senegal and Guinea. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens poured through the border and are now living in Ziguinchor province.

EVTDESC955203;The Great Powers organized a conference in the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ capital to establish several protocols and rules for the occupation of Africa and the abolition of slavery in the dark continent.

Mobs have gathered in the streets as news of the Greek ambitions in Anatolia spread. They drag Greeks to the streets and mark the doors of known Greek residences. Soon the soldiers joined in and as the day went by the killings spread. It didn’t stop for many days. Many tried to flee as the massacre spread from the heart of the Ottoman Empire to the rest of the country.\n Some say they are sanctioned by the government, some say they are spontaneous.

EVTDESC993520;William I of Orange-Nassau was installed as monarch of the United Low Countries after the defeat of Napoleon at the battle of Leipzig in 1813. Following the desire of the Great Powers at the Congress of Vienna to restore the old aristocratic order to Europe, William throughout his reign has prevented most attempts at Liberal reform by his ministers. This combined with his zealous belief in the Protestant faith has lead to Belgian declaration of independence in 1830. Despite this William has persisted in maintaining his Absolutist policies. The cracks are starting to show, only time will tell whether William will prevail or whether he will have to give in to the reformists like the other Western-European monarchies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC993887;With the war now over and our control over the Mexican hinterlands established, the Mexicans have taken to guerilla fighting and passive resistance. If the occupation continues, the unrest is bound to continue as well. We could grant the Mexican states some level of federal autonomy in order to keep them satisfied.

In the melee, 67 of our soldiers were killed and the rest captured. At noon as the remainder of the American soldiers were being driven out, a new Mexican republic was announced at the Plaza del Zócalo, with a declaration of war against the United States following suit to a massive croud and chants of 'Independencia!'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA993892;What a pity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC993893;Mexico has been part of the union for many years now, but the people of Mexico have always been treated as second rate citizens, and the lands south of the Rio Grande as an occupied territory to be colonized by the white Anglo-Saxon protestant ruling class. Yet, over the late 19th century, the people of Mexico have moved from being farmers and labourers on American plantations and in American mines, to being intellectuals, business owners, and even landowners themselves. The religious fervor of the 19th century is passing and the slew of Roman Catholic immigrants from Europe has made the population more tolerant of the Catholic faith in Mexico as well. While for many Spanish is still a native language and English a secondary one, in most ways the average Mexican is becoming more and more indistinguishable from the average American. The people of Mexico do hold American citizenship, of course, but it will still be an effort in order to fully integrate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC993895;With our victory in the Civil War our control of Mexico is now uncontested. As our troops march into Mexico City in a parade reminiscent of one commemorating our victory in the first Mexican-American war, it is clearer than ever that the people of Mexico resent our presence. Still, their fighting spirit is broken, for now.\n\nPerhaps, with time, they will learn to be American citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME993895;Civil War in Mexico Has Ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC994180;While New England, and especially Boston, may have been where the events that would become the American War of Independence, and which lost us our most prized posessions in the New World, first started unfolding, there is no doubt that it is also the part of the United States that has most shared in our liberal, mercantile, middle-class values. The Union has been wrought with conflict throughout its existence, with cultural differences between the industrial north and agrarian south proving hard to reconcile. After the recent war with the United States, we were approached by a group of representatives from these the formerly United States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York, who petitioned us to allow them to organize a state under our dominion. Some in our government are mistrustful, rightly so, of their intentions, but others insist it would be foolish to think we could effectively govern an area the size of Great Britain, populated by people of what is by now most definitely a foreign culture, from a quarter of a world away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Unofficial ones range from Red for (Great) Russia, White for White Russia, and Blue for Little Russia. It was used as civil ensign since Peter the Great. It inspired Slavic Nationalists to adopt the tricolore as basis of their flags in 19th century. \n Black-§YYellow-§WWhite§b: On 11 June 1858, by decree of Alexander II, the heraldic colors of the empire were approved for flags, banners and other items.
