EVTDESC110011;The English Anglo-Persian Oil Company was the first company to extract petroleum from $COUNTRY$. In 1901 William Knox D’Arcy negotiated an oil concession with Mozaffar al-Din: he would assume exclusive rights to prospect for 60 years in a vast tract of territory and in exchange the Shah received 20,000¤, an equal amount in shares, and a promise of future profits. In early May 1908 D’Arcy, having sunk more than 500,000¤ into his Persian venture and found no oil, sent a telegram saying that they had run out of money and ordering to ‘cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost and come home.’ The geologist George Bernard Reynolds delayed following these orders and in a stroke of luck, struck oil shortly after on May 26, 1908.

EVTDESC110020;On $YEAR$, the Shah granted foreigners a concession over the production, sale, and export of tobacco for fifty years. In exchange, they paid the Shah an annual sum plus a share of the profits. A Tobacco Régie (monopoly) was subsequently established and all the producers and owners of tobacco were forced to sell their goods to agents of the Régie, who would then resell the purchased tobacco. The concession represented a major blow to Persian farmers and bazaaris whose livelihoods were largely dependent on the lucrative tobacco business. Mass protests against the Régie began to emerge in major Iranian cities, spearheaded by the bazaari. The ulema proved to be a highly valuable ally of them as key religious leaders sought to defend traditional values and protect national interests from foreign domination. The brewing discontent threatens to rip our country apart, but giving in to their demands might have even more serious consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110028;Bazaari is the name given to the merchants and workers of bazaars, the traditional marketplaces of Iran. Bazaaris differ from a social class as usually defined in that they include both rich wholesalers and bankers as well as lower-income workers. They are united not in their resistance to dependence on the West and the spread of Western ways, their traditionalist attitude and their close family, financial, and cultural ties with the Shia ulama or clerical class. Bazaari, led by its large merchants, in alliance with ulama clergy, have played an important part in recent Iranian history. The troubles have spread and the support of the nascent entrepreneur middle-class to our traditional elites could prove fatal to the economy and the social order.

EVTDESC110029;In 1864 until the early 20th century, another mass expulsion took place of Caucasian Muslims as a result of the Russian victory in the Caucasian War. These migrations once again, towards Iran, included masses of Azerbaijanis, other Transcaucasian and North Caucasian Muslims, such as Circassians, Shia Lezgins and Laks. Many of these migrants would prove to play a pivotal role in further Iranian history, as they formed most of the ranks of the Persian Cossack Brigade. Formed in 1879 in Persia. It was modelled after the Caucasian Cossack regiments of the Imperial Russian Army and, until 1920, it was commanded by Russian officers. Together with a Swedish trained and officered gendarmerie, the Cossack Brigade came to comprise the most effective military force available to the Iranian crown in the years prior to World War I and its most elite cavalry unit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110050;Guided Democracy was the political system in place in Indonesia until the New Order began. It was the brainchild of President Sukarno, and was an attempt to bring about political stability. He believed that Western-style democracy was inappropriate for Indonesia’s situation. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, which occurred under the guidance of village elders. Sukarno proposed a threefold blend of nasionalisme (‘nationalism’), agama (‘religion’), and komunisme (‘communism’) into a co-operative ‘Nas-A-Kom’ government. This was intended to appease the three main factions in Indonesian politics-the army, Islamic groups, and the communists. With the support of the military, he proclaimed, ‘Guided Democracy’-western-style parliamentary democracy was thus finished in Indonesia until the Reformasi era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110056;The H. L. Hunley was one of the first submarine built by the CSA, but named and mostly financed after its main inventor, Horace Lawson Hunley. It played a small but symbolic part in the American Civil War by demonstrating the advantages and dangers of undersea warfare. She was the first combat submarine to actually sink a warship, which was an important step in the naval arms-race going on at the time: indeed, the Yankees had also developed their first submarine, the USS Alligator, while the Confederation had already lost two prototypes.

But Dixon and a crew of seven volunteers successfully navigated the waters and aimed to reach the blockade. There, they spotted the USS Housatonic and began their approach. While the Yankees did see them, they were unable to fight back and the Hunley launched its torpedo swinging in the flank of the 1,260-ton vessel, sinking it in less than five minutes. The men then set for home and narrowly made it. Thus, the Hunley became the first submarine ship to successfully sink an enemy boat, marking History forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Not understanding the significance of the stool, he clearly had no inkling of the storm his words would produce: the suggestion that he, a foreigner, should sit upon and defile the Golden Stool, the very embodiment of the Ashanti state, and very symbol of the Ashanti peoples, living, dead, and yet to be born, was far too insufferable for the crowd.

EVTDESC110078;Jack the Ripper is the best known name given to an unidentified serial killer generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in $YEAR$. Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. The 'From Hell' letter received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee included half of a preserved human kidney, purportedly taken from one of the victims. The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as 'Jack the Ripper', mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal character of the murders and because of media treatment of the events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC111003;The Ethiopian Emperor Tewodros II wrote a letter to Queen Victoria as a fellow Christian monarch, asking for British assistance. Tewodros asked the British Consul, Captain Charles Duncan Cameron, to carry a letter to Queen Victoria requesting skilled workers to come to teach his subjects how to produce firearms, and other technical skills. \n \n On Cameron’s return, the Emperor became enraged when he found out that Cameron had not taken the letter to London personally and had not brought a response from the Queen. \n \n The British sent a mission under Hormuzd Rassam, bearing a letter from the Queen. He did not bring the skilled workers as requested. Deeply insulted by the British failure to do exactly as they were told, Tewodros had the members of the Rassam mission imprisoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Tewodros II attempted to make peace. Napier responded with a message thanking him for this peace offering and stating that he would treat the Emperor and his family with every dignity. Tewodros II furiously responded that he would never be taken prisoner. \n \n The British shelled Magdala, killing most of Tewodros II’s remaining loyal men.

EVTDESC113901;Some prospectors in Ballarat have struck a huge gold nugget, found only 3 cm below the surface, near a bark of a tree on a slope leading to what is known as Bulldog Gully. Its gross weight is 109.59 kg and the trimmed weight is 78 kg. At the time of the discovery there were no scales capable of weighing a nugget this large, so it was broken into three pieces on an anvil by Dunolly-based blacksmith Archibald Wall. The nugget was soon melted down and the gold was sent as ingots to Melbourne for forwarding to the Bank of $COUNTRY$. It still remains the biggest gold nugget ever found.\nAll around Australia, this finding triggered gold rushes, prospecting and expeditions.

Because of the growing reputation, the firm G.J. Droste opened its first factory in 1890. In 1891, the factory was relocated to the Spaarne river due to lack of room in the old building. This new location was favourable because the materials could now be delivered and sent by boat. In 1897, the leadership of the Droste factory was handed over to the sons of Gerardus J. Droste. By then Droste's assortment had grown to numerous cocoa and chocolate products, the famous Dutch chocolate letters included. The company had also been winning a significant market share in both the Netherlands and foreign countries, in spite of the competition from larger chocolate manufacturers.

EVTDESC187890;There are a growing number of Freemasons within Brazilian churches, which is nominally prohibited in Catholicism - they exist most commonly within Lay Fraternities, which are generally charitable organizations chiefly associated with local churches, though technically independent in their operation. Historically, however, the church in Brazil has been an apparatus of the state, rather than being independent, thus making religious issues in Brazil matters of the state, not the Catholic Church. Local bishops have been calling for Freemason clergymen to resign, including a man named Dom Vital, who has issued an interdict against certain Lay Fraternities that have refused to have their Freemason brothers resign, preventing any sacraments from being celebrated within these Fraternity buildings. This goes against the state control of the Church, so the Lay brothers say, and is a direct challenge to government power considering that certain members of Parliament are noted Freemasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC187892;Dom Vidal has refused to annul his controversial interdict, and has been joined in protest by the bishop Antonio de Macedo Costa, who has recently passed a similar interdict against uncooperative Lay Fraternities.

The New Prime Minister, a Freemason and a Catholic himself, has called for his own resignation in the case that amnesty is not granted to Costa and Vidal. We have little choice at this point, considering that keeping the bishops in prison would only lead to the government crumbling.

Uruguay's leaders fiercely protected free speech within the nation's parliament - even when legislators voiced views that directly opposed those of the president. These measures did not mean that Uruguay's early decades were easy or calm, however: in addition to threats from its much larger neighbours, the young nation suffered from internal strife. The new constitution had made José Fructuoso Rivera the country's first president. When his political rival, Manuel Oribe became president in 1834, Fructuoso revolted against him. By the mid-1830s, two fiercely opposed political parties had emerged from these internal struggles. Oribe headed a group called the Blancos, who mainly represented gauchos, shepherds, and other rural citizens.

EVTOPTA200100;A ceremonial friendship treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB200100;Attempt to create a substantive border treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC200101;We could attempt to solve the Transylvania troubles in several ways. Hungary has been the traditional owner of the land, and as such, we could reassert Hungarian claims to the region. However, Romanians are the majority population of much of Transylvania, and therefore, we could support Romanian self-determination. It is unlikely either of these proposals would be warmly welcomed by the losing party. Therefore, we could also suggest a partitioning of Transylvania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I pushed back the crowds and walked down a living avenue of people until I came in front of the semicircle of Arabs, in the front of which stood the white man with the gray beard.

I would have run to him, only I was a coward in the presence of such a mob, - would have embraced him, only, he being an Englishman, I did not know how he would receive me, so I did what cowardice and false pride suggested was the best thing, - walked deliberately to him, took off my hat, and said:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
