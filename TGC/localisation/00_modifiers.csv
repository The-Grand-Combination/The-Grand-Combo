collectivisation_desc;Marxist doctrine emphasized the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ whereby the workers would take control of the means of the production and ultimately own their own factories and farms in a utopian socialist vision of collectivism. The architects of Communist state ideology were inevitably unable to deliver this utopian vision. What resulted instead was a dramatic expansion of state economic planning and central control over all industries and industrial production. Housing and infrastructure projects also became state-owned and directed. Heavy industry was to be emphasized above consumer goods. Private ownership of land was largely ended, and early attempts at land redistribution became massive collectivization projects whereby huge farms were organized in a factory-like manner. As with factories, delivery of raw materials and production quotas were set by central planning agencies. In all of these areas, the inherent problems of deficiencies and impossible targets came to the fore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
