collectivisation;Collectivisation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
collectivisation_desc;Marxist doctrine emphasized the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ whereby the workers would take control of the means of the production and ultimately own their own factories and farms in a utopian socialist vision of collectivism. The architects of Communist state ideology were inevitably unable to deliver this utopian vision. What resulted instead was a dramatic expansion of state economic planning and central control over all industries and industrial production. Housing and infrastructure projects also became state-owned and directed. Heavy industry was to be emphasized above consumer goods. Private ownership of land was largely ended, and early attempts at land redistribution became massive collectivization projects whereby huge farms were organized in a factory-like manner. As with factories, delivery of raw materials and production quotas were set by central planning agencies. In all of these areas, the inherent problems of deficiencies and impossible targets came to the fore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

f2empiredesc;In 1848, the voters of the second French Republic choose Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, who had returned from British exile in September, as their president. During the next two years, President Bonaparte played his cards carefully, trying to win the hearts of the Roman Catholics and the population. During his mandate, his efforts to please the assembly probably derived from his hope that the assembly would reciprocate: he wanted funds from the treasury to pay his personal debts and run his household, along with a constitutional amendment that would allow him to run for a second term. By 1851 it was clear that the majority of the assembly was not ready to give the president what he wanted. Louis-Napoléon didn’t want to step down and proceeded with a plebiscite to emend the constitution. At the same time, officially inspired petitions for a restoration of the empire began to flow to Paris. The Senate responded to what it described as the nation’s desires, and on December 2, 1852…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The plan was implemented in 1928 and took effect until 1932. The Soviet Union entered a series of five-year plans which began in 1928 under the rule of Joseph Stalin. Stalin launched what would later be referred to as a ‘revolution from above’ to improve the Soviet Union’s domestic policy. The policies were centred around rapid industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture. Stalin desired to remove and replace any policies created under the New Economic Policy. The plan, overall, was to transition the Soviet Union from a weak, poorly controlled, agriculture state, into an industrial powerhouse. While the vision was grand, its planning was ineffective and unrealistic given the short amount of time given to meet the desired goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In many ways, the tax signified the decentralization of state authority in the wake of the Taiping rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He was best known for his support of constitutional government with a clear separation of powers. In his most famous work, ‘The Spirit of the Laws (1748)’, Montesquieu developed a series of classification systems to describe governments and societies. He divided French society into three classes: the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the commons, and he said that they should be equally dependent on and separate from each other. Government administration was divided into three branches, the executive, legislative, and the judicial. His separation of powers later became embedded in the U.S. and other modern constitutions. He popularized the term ‘Despotism’ by describing it as one of the three basic forms of government, along with Monarchy and Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It represents the first advanced civilization in mainland Greece, with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art and writing system. \n\nThe Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, the Linear B, offers the first written records of the Greek language and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon.\n\nMycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax. Mycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

national_socialism_desc;National Socialism was an extreme form of the ideology of Fascism, which grew out of global instability after the Great War. National Socialists started with the basic tenets of Fascism, including the Leadership Principle, the Police State, a mass movement, the suppression of Democratic institutions and the subordination of industry and labour to the state. They added ideas derived from social-Darwinism, Eugenics, and Ultranationalist thinkers. This produced a highly toxic and perverted ideology that promised to make the national community or ‘Volk’ healthy, strong, and dominant. Along with traditional racism towards non-whites, members of minority religions, Eastern European cultures, and especially the Jews were to be forcibly deported, encouraged to emigrate, sterilized, or simply exterminated. ‘Racial Science’ determined them to be inferior not only socially and culturally, but also biologically. National Socialist or ‘Nazi’ movements primarily sprung up in ‘Western’ states in the first half of the Twentieth Century, though Japan developed its own theories of race akin to the Nordic ‘Aryan’ superman based on the ‘Yamato’ Culture. Communism was the great ideological enemy of the National Socialists;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
