1850_compromise_desc;Senators Henry Clay and Stephen A. Douglas have presented a draft proposal for a compromise on the slavery issue centred around the premise of popular sovereignty as the determinant for slavery or abolitionism in the territories. By supporting the draft proposal, we could calm tensions over the slavery issue for at least some time. The compromise is a package of five separate bills which will defuse a four-year political confrontation between slave and free states regarding the status of territories acquired during the Mexican-American War. The mains points are:\n1. Texas surrenders its claim to New Mexico, over which it had threatened war, as well as its claims north of the Missouri Compromise Line. It retains the Texas Panhandle and the federal government will took over the state�s public debt.\n2. California is admitted as a free state with its current boundaries.\n3.The Wilmot Proviso will be fully rejected.\n4.The slave trade (but not slavery altogether) will be banned in Washington D.C.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

abolish_los_fueros_desc;The relentless centralizing drive of the Spanish Crown led, after the end of the First Carlist War, to the reduction of the Basque institutional and legal system (called Fueros), but it was only after the last Carlist War that it was virtually wiped out. After the war, a new Spanish constitution was drawn up in order to establish a unitarian and central administration in Spain cut out according to a Spanish-Castilian pattern. Navarre was affected, but for the moment it was spared from further curtailments due to their 1841 �Compromise Act� (Ley Paccionada) that turned officially the semi-autonomous Kingdom of Navarre into another province of Spain. The Basques were forced to enrol in the Spanish military on an individual basis, and not in separate groups or corps, despite the fact that many Basques could hardly articulate a pair of phrases in Spanish, exposing them at best to stressful experiences. These changes allowed Spain to turn in a modern unified country, shaking off the last bits of the Ancien R�gime, the first step to end the regionalism driving the forces behind the Carlists and Christinos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Throughout the ages the institution had undergone several reforms and changes, but the first steps toward a complete abolishment were taken only in the 1810s, when the institution was abolished in the Russian domains of Kurland, Estonia and Livonia. The institution was only abolished in all of Russia with the agrarian reform of 1861, during the reign of Tsar Alexander II, who at the time feared that the Russian peasantry might otherwise seek their liberation through outright revolution.;Le syst�me de servage, une main-d'�uvre priv�e de libert� rattach�e aux terres d'un noble local, une forme d'esclavage f�odal, a exist� en Russie depuis la Rus' de Kiev du XIe si�cle. Au fil du temps, ce syst�me a fait l'objet de plusieurs r�formes et �volutions, mais les premi�res mesures d'abolition ne furent prises que dans les ann�es 1810, �poque � laquelle il fut aboli dans les domaines russes du Kurland, d'Estonie et de Livonie. Il fallut attendre la r�forme agraire de 1861 pour voir l'abolition totale de ce syst�me, sous le r�gne du tsar Alexandre II qui craignait, � l'�poque, un soul�vement de la paysannerie russe.;Die Einf�hrung der Leibeigenschaft�unfreie Landarbeit auf den L�ndereien eines lokalen Adligen, also eine Art feudaler Sklaverei�hatte in Russland seit der Kiewer Rus im elften Jahrhundert in verschiedenen Formen existiert. Im Laufe der wurde die Leibeigenschaft mehreren Reformen und Ver�nderungen unterworfen, aber erste Schritte in Richtung einer vollst�ndigen Abschaffungen wurden erst in den 1810er Jahren unternommen, als die Leibeigenschaft in den russischen Dom�nen Kurland, Estland und Livland abgeschafft wurde. Im restlichen Russland wurde sie erst w�hrend der Herrschaft von Zar Alexander II. im Zuge der Agrarreform von 1861 abgeschafft. Der Zar bef�rchtete damals, dass sich die russischen Bauern ansonsten ihre Freiheit durch eine offene Revolution holen w�rden.;;;;;;;;;;;x

abolish_slavery_desc;Slavery is legal in our nation, but no slaves are found in our fields. With slavery becoming rarer and rarer in the world, the more liberal and abolitionist sectors of our society could gain enough power to pass a bill in the UH, arguing that �abolishing this outdated institution from our country will elevate our us in the eyes of the civilized nations�.

abolish_slavery_romania_desc;The earliest law which freed a category of slaves was in March 1843 in Wallachia, which transferred the control of the state slaves owned by the prison authority to the local authorities, leading to their sedentarisation and becoming peasants.

More urgently, Alexander agreed to other liberalizations of Russian society. Among these were the creation of representative bodies called zemstva, in effect a form of local government in villages and provinces, given authority to dispense education, charitable relief and other services.

back_to_africa_act_desc;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonization Society was an early advocate of the idea of resettling $COUNTRY_ADJ$-born blacks in Africa. Founded in 1816, it was composed of two core groups: abolitionists and slave owners. Abolitionist members believed in freeing African slaves, along with their descendants, and providing them with the opportunity to return to Africa. Slave owning members believed free blacks endangered the system of slavery and sought to expel them from $COUNTRY$. Their efforts were ultimately fruitless as they didn't attract a significant numbers of colonizers. With the support of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, resettling won't be optional. By signing the "Back to Africa Act" we can fulfil their purpose, this time through the forceful repatriation of the Afro-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ community in our core territories. It won't be fast and it will attract a lot of negative attention from around the international community, but we can continue on the work of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonization Society in repatriating the African diaspora in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Over the years, effective power in the Sultanate was increasingly taken up by the Dutch Resident.\n\nIn 1852 the Sultan�s heir-apparent died, and the Dutch replaced him by the illegitimate grandson Tamjied Illah. In vain, Sultan Adam and many nobles sent an emissary to Batavia, pointing out iniquities perpetrated by the Dutch-designated heir and appealing for the Dutch to recognise instead Hidayatullah�a younger but legitimate son.\n\nSultan Adam soon died and was succeeded by the illegitimate Tamjied Illah. There ensued a struggle for power between Tamjied Illah and Hidayatullah, which divided the population, much of which stood behind Hidayatullah and highly resented the Dutch sponsoring of Tamjied Illah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

berlin_baghdad_railway_desc;The Berlin-Baghdad Railway, also known as the Baghdad Railway was built from 1903 to 1940 to connect Berlin with the Ottoman Empire city of Baghdad, from where the Germans wanted to establish a port in the Persian Gulf, with 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) line through modern-day Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. Funding and engineering was mainly provided by German Empire banks and companies, which in the 1890s had built the Anatolian Railway (Anatolische Eisenbahn) connecting Constantinople, Ankara and Konya. The Ottoman Empire wished to maintain its control of Arabian Peninsula and to expand its influence across the Red Sea into the nominally Ottoman Khedivate of Egypt, which had been under British military control since the Urabi Revolt in 1882.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Over the course of the 19th century this involvement gradually increased. The colonial government was, in particular, interested in fostering trade as this provided it with its main source of revenue, in the form of customs duties and other taxes.

Aufbauend auf seine eigenen Erfahrungen begann Dunant, Ideen zur Einrichtung eines internationalen Komitees der Hilfsgesellschaften f�r die Verwundetenpflege zu formulieren und unternahm in der Schweiz extensive Vortragsreisen. Vor dem Hintergrund dieser Ideen berief das schweizer Parlament 1864 in Genf eine internationale Konvention ein, um international g�ltige Gesetze f�r die Kriegsf�hrung aufzustellen.;;;;;;;;;;;x

During the Joseon Dynasty of Korea Jeju islanders were treated as foreigners and Jeju was considered as a place for horse breeding and exile for political prisoners. In the 17th Century, Injo of Joseon issued an edict prohibiting islanders from traveling to the Korean mainland. Despite the poverty, the Island would serve as a good base to exert influence over Korea and Japan and it�s the place that�s more likely to be ceded-the current owners don�t care about it too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

clear_out_the_manchu_elite_desc;Since the beginning of the Qing dynasty, the Chinese Imperial administration and bureaucracy had been dominated by a powerful Manchu elite, and the Qing emperors had traditionally discriminated heavily against ethnic Han. In the 1860s, Empress Dowager Cixi effectively ended this practice, when she entrusted the country�s most powerful military unit to a man of Han background, Zeng Guofan, during the suppression of the Taiping rebellion. By getting rid of the Manchu elite, we can take an important step toward modernization.;Depuis le d�but de la dynastie Qing, l'administration et la bureaucratie de l'Empire chinois sont domin�es par une puissante �lite mandchoue et les empereurs Qing se sont attach�s � discriminer l'ethnie Han.

collectivise_farms_desc;State farms, began to be created in the early 1920s as an ideological example of �socialist agriculture of the highest order�. Kolkhozes or collective farms were regarded for a long time as an intermediate stage in the transition to the ideal of state farming. While kolkhozy were typically created by combining small individual farms together in a cooperative structure, a sovkhoz would be organised by the state on land confiscated from former large estates and sovkhoz workers would be recruited from among landless rural residents. The sovkhoz employees would be paid regulated wages, whereas the remuneration system in a kolkhoz relied on cooperative-style distribution of farm earnings (in cash and in kind) among the members. In farms of both types, however, a system of internal passports prevented movement of employees and members from rural areas to urban areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

colonization_of_fernando_po_desc;The king, with sufficient advance notice, prepared a reception for the visitors, the kind of reception only he could prepare. From the outskirts of the town to the palace of the mochucu, the street was lined with two long lines of Bubi warriors, daubed with red, with rifles and lances and holding buffalo-skin shields. They cheered for $COUNTRY$. At the end was the aged King Moka, standing next to his throne made of tree trunks. He still looked arrogant and for the reception he had, naturally, put on his best finery: the two-point full-dress hat of a marine official and an old frock coat, but without the trousers. The monkey skin apron hung from his waist, and in his right hand he flaunted his staff of command. To his right was Abba Moote, high priest of the Bubi, with his paddle in his hand, emblem of his dignity. To his left, his first lieutenant, Sas Ebuera. The elderly counsellors and the king�s sixty wives crowded after him. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag Moka had received as a gift waved over the palace door. After two days of conferences and after having exchanged the customary gifts and tightened the bonds between $COUNTRY$ and Moka, the visitors returned to Santa Isabel, not without the governor having granted the king permission to use gunpowder�\n\nThe island of Fernando P� has been the stage of numerous colonization attempts by the Spanish and the British. The north of the island is home to its only European settlement, founded by the British as a base of operations to end the slave trade in the Atlantic. Despite that, expansion of the colonization efforts have been largely hampered by the Bubi people, unified in a monarchy under king Moka.

During the 19th century, Russians began to settle in Tuva. The Qing Dynasty allowed Russians to settle providing that they lived in boats or tents.

conquer_conakry_desc;Since the 18th century, Portuguese, British and French traders had established small stations on the coast which was called Rivi�res du Sud by the French. The Portuguese had trading stations at Rio Pongo and Rio Nunez, mostly for the purchase of enslaved Africans captured inland and brought to the coast. By 1820, British suppression of the slave trade and Portuguese imperial decline saw these posts abandoned, with British and French traders moving in. The French admiral Bou�t-Willaumez made a number of treaties with coastal communities in the area (usually under the threat of force), and ensured Marseilles based trade houses exclusive access to the palm oil trade by the 1840s. Used for making soap, the palm oil trade was with Diola merchants who established markets in the interior, and transported it to the coastal stations.

create_pakistan_desc;The movement for Muslim self-awakening and identity was started by the Muslim modernist and reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, considered the architect of the two-nation theory. The two-nation theory is the ideology that the primary identity and unifying denominator of Muslims in the South Asian subcontinent is their religion, rather than their language or ethnicity, and therefore Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations, regardless of ethnic or other commonalities. To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was �a complete social order which affects all the activities in life� and �where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded�. By recognizing the Two-Nation Theory and the Muslim demand, we will open the path for them to create their own nation in the South Asian subcontinent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cremieux_decree_desc;The Cremieux Decree was a law that gave French citizenship to about 35,000 Jews in French Algeria. It was named for French-Jewish lawyer and Minister of Justice Adolphe Cremieux, who had founded the Alliance Israelite Universelle a decade earlier. \n\n At the same time the naturalization regime in French Algeria was confirmed in Decree 137, determining that Muslims are not French citizens in the French colony of Algeria. The aim was to maintain the status quo, the sovereignty of France over its North African colonies. Five years later, in 1875, this was confirmed in the framework of the Code de l�indigenat. \n\n The decree allowed for native Jews to automatically become French citizens while Muslim Arabs and Berbers were excluded and remained under the second-class indigenous status outlined in the Code de l�Indigenat. They could, on paper, request French citizenship, but requests were very seldom accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Only a small minority of broken survivors returned to France to tell how horrible it was;they sometimes scared other potential criminals to go straight.

In response to these events, the poet and merchant Max Schneckenburger wrote a patriotic poem calling on the �Fatherland to remain calm�, for, as the poem says, �fast and true stands the watch at the Rhine�, implying that the German nation would defend the river against any and all aggression. The poem was put to music in 1854, and became extremely popular in Germany during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dissolve_the_upper_house_desc;Supreme executive power in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state emanates from $CAPITAL$, through the figure of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch. The absolute monarch is the final authority in all matters of the state, but the bureaucracy and the military are the pillars that sustain the absolutist government. In addition, the landed aristocracy, which often acts as the bureaucracy, expects and receives positions of power in the government, positions appointed by the monarch. This is necessary for the normal function of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state�the aristocrats are the governor generals, the privy-councillors, the high-ranking bureaucrats, the ministers, the judges and the executors of the monarch�s decisions. For these functions, several government institutions exist and are populated by the landed nobility�the Committee of Ministers of $COUNTRY$, the Governing Senate, the State Council. They help draft and apply laws, manage foreign and internal policy, plan wars and administer the military, advise the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch as well as judge and administer justice. The monarch still can and has the final say in all these matters, and is his royal prerogative to do away the currently appointed aristocrats and pick new ones. By taking this step�effectively dissolving the upper house and appointing new ministers�the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch can surround himself with sycophants and petty nobility that are willing to do whatever he wants them to do�for a time, at least. This break in the unspoken agreement between the monarch and the bureaucrats, the monarch and the aristocracy, will bring consequences�besides exposing internal fractures in the government to the international community, it is sure to anger the nobles and sow confusion throughout the government ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

embrace_the_boer_desc;The Dutch East Indies company rule in South Africa was tyrannical: they closed the colony against free immigration, kept the whole of the trade in its own hands, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers in one body, prescribed to the farmers the nature of the crops they were to grow, demanded from them a large part of their produce, and harassed them with other exactions tending to discourage industry and enterprise. The effect of this tyranny was inevitable: it drove men to desperation. They fled from oppression, and thus trekking began. The colony changed hands but many of the Boer farmers were as dissatisfied with British rule as they had been with the Dutch East India Company, though their ground of complaint was not the same. By making amends with the Boer farmers, paying compensation, abolishing Company rule and administrating the colonies directly, we can make amends and make the Boers accept our rule, to finally put an end to the trekking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

enact_female_suffrage_desc;The idea of Woman�s Suffrage increasingly gained traction in Western society throughout the 19th century. First advocated in the writings of early liberal philosophers, such as England�s Mary Wollstonecraft or John Stuart Mill, the idea and ideology of Woman�s Suffrage gradually developed, as the century wore on, into a coherent ideology in its own right: Feminism. The experience during The First World War, of women working in factories, and other jobs previously reserved for men during peacetime, is often said to have been a crucial pivot point in securing Woman�s right to work, vote, and, in other fields of society, achieve legal equality with men.;Au XIXe si�cle, la question du droit de vote des femmes gagne de plus en plus de terrain. Initialement d�fendue dans les �crits des premiers philosophes lib�raux, parmi lesquels les britanniques Mary Woolstonecraft ou John Stuart Mill, l'id�e du droit de vote des femmes s'est progressivement r�pandue au fil du si�cle pour donner lieu � une id�ologie � part enti�re : le f�minisme. L'exp�rience de la Premi�re Guerre mondiale, lorsque les femmes travaill�rent en usine et exerc�rent des m�tiers jusque l� r�serv�s aux hommes, serait l'un des pivots du droit des femmes � travailler, � voter et, dans d'autres domaines de la soci�t�, � atteindre un statut d'�galit� avec les hommes.;Die Idee des Frauenwahlrechts fasste im Verlauft des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts in der westlichen Gesellschaft immer mehr Fu�. Zuerst von fr�hen liberalen Philosophen wie Englands Mary Woolstonecraft oder John Stuart Mill unterst�tzt, entwickelte sich die Idee und Ideologie des Frauenwahlrechts im weiteren Verlauf des Jahrhundert allm�hlich zu einer eigenen, koh�renten Ideologie, dem Feminismus.

During his reign he instituted a series of more or less popular, and more or less successful, reforms, all aiming to transform Egypt into a modern, European-style, state.

enact_radical_reconstruction_desc;Reconstruction is the collective term used to described the policies, laws, decrees, constitutional amendments and presidential orders enacted, after the American Civil War, with the goal of reintegrating the former Confederate states back into the Union. The policies centred chiefly around issues like the ending of �Slave Power�, the suppression of Southern nationalism and revanchism, and the recognition of the 13th amendment by the Southern states. Reconstruction ended with the compromise 1877, when federal troops where finally withdrawn from the South. The Confederate banners lie trampled in the ashes of Savannah and Richmond, and it�s time to start the reconstruction.;La reconstruction est le terme collectif utilis� pour d�crire les politiques, lois, d�crets, amendements constitutionnels et d�cisions pr�sidentielles adopt�s apr�s la guerre de S�cession afin de r�int�grer les �tats conf�d�r�s dans l'Union.

enslave_the_serfs_desc;Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the Lord of the Manor who owned that land, and in return were entitled to protection, justice and the right to exploit certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. Serfs were often required not only to work on the lord�s fields, but also his mines, forests and roads. A lord of the manor could not sell his serfs. On the other hand, if he chose to dispose of a parcel of land, the serfs associated with that land stayed with it to serve their new lord, benefiting him with their long-acquired knowledge of practices suited to the land. Further, a serf could not abandon his lands without permission, nor did he possess a saleable title in them. But through their condition of near slavery, we can revoke more rights of the serfs and force them in total slavery, untying them from the land and tying them to the lords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

forced_mycenaean_excavations_desc;Mycenaean Greece was the last phase of the Bronze Age in Ancient Greece, spanning the period from approximately 1600�1100 BC. It represents the first advanced civilization in mainland Greece, with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art and writing system. \n\nThe Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, the Linear B, offers the first written records of the Greek language and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon.\n\nMycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax. Mycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The difference between the two was that Mittelafrika would be an agglomeration of German colonies in Africa, while Mitteleuropa was conceptualised as a geostrategic buffer zone between Germany and Russia to be filled with puppet states. \n\nGerman strategic thinking was that if the region between the colonies of German East Africa, German South-West Africa, and Cameroon could be annexed, a contiguous entity could be created covering the breadth of the African continent from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Given the richness in natural resources of the Belgian Congo alone, this region would accrue considerable wealth to the colonising power through the exploitation of natural resources, as well as contributing to another German aim of economic self-sufficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

form_pakistan_desc;The movement for Muslim self-awakening and identity was started by the Muslim modernist and reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, considered the architect of the two-nation theory. The two-nation theory is the ideology that the primary identity and unifying denominator of Muslims in the South Asian subcontinent is their religion, rather than their language or ethnicity, and therefore Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations, regardless of ethnic or other commonalities. To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was �a complete social order which affects all the activities in life� and �where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded�. To guarantee the Muslim population of the South Asian subcontinent will not be dominated by Hindus and to guarantee they will have a place in society, it would be under our best interests to assert our hegemony in the area and create a nation for all Muslims in South Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

founding_yadanabon_desc;In $YEAR$, King Mindon of $COUNTRY$ ordered a new royal capital to be built at the foot of Mandalay Hill in order to fulfil a prophecy on the founding of a metropolis of Buddhism in that exact place on the occasion of the 2,400th jubilee of Buddhism. The new capital city site was 66 sq. km in area, surrounded by four rivers. The plan called for a 144-square block grid patterned citadel, anchored by a 16 square block royal palace compound at the centre by Mandalay Hill. The 1020-acre citadel was to be surrounded by four 2,032 m long walls and a moat 64 m wide, 4.6 m deep. At intervals of 169 m along the wall, turrets were built with gold-tipped spires for watchmen. The walls had three gates on each side, and five bridges to cross the moat. In addition, the king also commissioned the Kuthodaw Pagoda, the Pahtan-haw Shwe Thein upasampada hall, the Thudamma �Good Dharma� zayats or public houses for preaching Buddhism and a library for the Pali Canon. The former royal palace of Amarapura was dismantled and moved by elephants to the new location at the foot of Mandalay. This new city would be named Yadanabon-City of Gems, a reference to the Valley of Rubies, 200 km to the north in the Mogok mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves � Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery.

In furthering his argument, Iwakura suggested that domestic rebellions was no longer Japan�s primary military concern and that that naval affairs should take precedence over army concerns;a strong navy was more important than a sizable army to preserve the Japanese state. Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status. Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy.

imperial_rescript_desc;Following the Meiji Restoration, the leadership of the Meiji government felt the need to emphasize the common goals of rapid modernization (westernization) with support and legitimization of the political system centred on the imperial institution. In the 1870s and 1880s, Motoda Nagazane and other conservatives pushed for a revival of the principles of Confucianism as a guide for education and public morality, however, Inoue Kowashi and other proponents of the 'modernization' of Japan felt that this would encourage a return to the old feudal order, and pushed for an 'emperor-centered' philosophy. Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo authorized the drafting of the Rescript, which was a compromise written largely by Inoue Kowashi with input from Motoda Nagazane and others.

Although it was not the only such �mission�, it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West. It was first proposed by the influential Dutch missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck and was probably based on the model of the Grand Embassy of Peter I. The purposes of the mission were twofold: To renegotiate the unequal treaties with the Great Powers that Japan had been forced into during the previous decades and to gather information on education, technology, culture, and military, social and economic structures from the countries visited in order to affect the modernization of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jamaican_crown_colony_desc;Although the black uprising of the Morant Bay rebellion had been ruthlessly suppressed, the severe rioting so alarmed the white Jamaican planters that the two-centuries-old assembly voted to abolish itself and asked for the establishment of direct British rule.\n\nIn $YEAR$ the new Crown colony government consisted of the Legislative Council and the executive Privy Council containing members of both chambers of the House of Assembly, but the Colonial Office exercised effective power through a presiding British governor. The council included a few handpicked prominent Jamaicans for the sake of appearance only. In the late nineteenth century, Crown colony rule was modified representation and limited self-rule were reintroduced gradually into Jamaica. The colony�s legal structure was reformed along the lines of English common law and county courts, and a constabulary force was established.\n\nThe smooth working of the Crown colony system was dependent on a good understanding and an identity of interests between the governing officials, who were British, and most of the nonofficial, nominated members of the Legislative Council, who were Jamaicans. The elected members of this body were in a permanent minority and without any influence or administrative power. The unstated alliance � based on shared colour, attitudes, and interest � between the British officials and the Jamaican upper class was reinforced in London, where the West India Committee lobbied for Jamaican interests. Jamaica�s white or near-white propertied class continued to hold the dominant position in every respect the vast majority of the black population remained poor and unenfranchised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jules_ferry_laws_desc;French education during the 19th century was marked by two distinct and segregated systems, the first being a secondary school system and the second a primary school system. However, in each of these systems, the Catholic Church provided an alternative to secular schooling that was often the only option for families in economically depressed regions of France. \n\nThe Jules Ferry Laws were a set of French Laws which established free education, then mandatory and laic (secular) education. Jules Ferry, a lawyer holding the office of Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, was widely credited for creating the modern Republican school (l'�cole r�publicaine). The dual system of state and church schools that were largely staffed by religious officials was replaced by state schools and lay school teachers. The educational reforms enacted by Jules Ferry are often attributed to a broader anti-clerical campaign in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Pope Pius IX refused to accept the laws, which were seen by both him and his successors as an infringement of the independence of the Holy See. While the issue was not conclusively solved until the Lateran Treaty of 1929, the Law of Guarantees nevertheless meant that the young Kingdom�s capital would from then on be Rome.;En 1870, la �Loi des garanties� fut pass�e par le tout jeune royaume d�Italie pour r�soudre la �question romaine�.

Insbesondere Gro�britannien, welches aus dem benachbarten Sierra Leone heraus operiert, betrachtet das Commonwealth und die Vaterorganisation American Colonization Society (ACS), als 'Privatpersonen' nicht berechtigt, Souver�nit�t aus�ben. Daher hielt man es f�r notwendig die Formalisierung zur Unabh�ngigkeit weiterzuf�hren. Obwohl durch die US-Regierung gebilligt, kam die diplomatische Anerkennung vom Kongress der neuen Republik nicht vor dem B�rgerkrieg.;;;;;;;;;;;x

luderitz_expedition_desc;First discovered in 1487 by the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias, the small coastal area known as Angra Pequena was made into a trading station by German trader Adolf L�deritz in 1883.

L�deritz has plans to send expeditions further north, in the place the natives call Otjozondjii, known in German as Swakopmund but under the belief that a Great Power was about to claim the area as a protectorate, L�deritz stalled his plans and asked for the protection of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government in $YEAR$.

megali_idea_desc;The �Megali Idea�, the Great Idea, was an irredentist conception of a Greater Greek state encompassing all ethnic Greeks, including in particular the substantial Greek minorities living on the Western Coast of Asia Minor. The concept was a driving force between much of Greece�s interactions with the fading Ottoman state during the 19th century, and the goals of the Great Idea came very close to a realization in the Treaty of S�vres, signed at the end of World War One. The vast land gains that the Treaty of S�vres accorded to Greece were however largely undone by the following Greco-Turkish war of 1919-21. Big is beautiful!;L�id�e �Megali�, la grande id�e, est une conception irr�dentiste d�une Grande Nation grecque qui rassemblerait tous les peuples d�ethnie grecque, en particulier la substantielle minorit� vivant sur la c�te occidentale de l�Asie mineure. Cette id�e motiva la plupart des interactions de la Gr�ce ave l'Empire ottoman agonisant au cours du XIXe si�cle et l'objectif de cr�ation d'une Grande Gr�ce fut bien pr�s d'�tre atteint lors de la signature du Trait� de S�vre, � la fin de la Premi�re guerre mondiale.

Dieses Konzept war eine treibende Kraft hinter den griechischen Interaktionen mit dem im Niedergang befindlichen osmanischen Staat w�hrend des 19. Jahrhunderts, und im Vertrag von S�vres, der am Ende des ersten Weltkriegs unterzeichnet wurde, kam man den Zielen der Gro�en Idee schon sehr nahe.

meiji_daijokan_ordinances_desc;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government announced the reformation of the land taxation system in $YEAR$ as part of the Daijokan Ordinances in Japan. The government initially ordered individual farmers to measure the plots of their land themselves, calculate their taxes, and submit the results to local tax officials. However, difficulties arose with the honesty of the measuring system when the budget showed that collected taxes fell far below projected values. Private land ownership was recognized for the first time in Japan with the issuing of land titles. The previous practice of land ownership was the Public Land Public Citizen Laws, which stated that all land was under the sole ownership of the emperor, such that individual farmers were merely borrowing the land from feudal lords, who in turn were borrowing the land from the emperor. The reform abolished this archaic system of land ownership, and began to allow landowners to use their property as a financial asset in collateral or other investment. This law was one of the first steps towards the development of capitalism in Japan, paralleling the English statute Quia Emptores enacted several centuries earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Pan-Malay union was based on understandings on similarities in race, shared language, religion and culture among ethnic groups.

There are calls for jihad by Muslim leaders like Maulana Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi and the millenarian Ahmedullah Shah, which were taken up by Muslims, particularly artisans, which caused the British to think that the Muslims were the main force behind this unrest. The Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah, resisted these calls for jihad because, it has been suggested, he feared outbreaks of communal violence. By abiding to these calls, expelling the British from Delhi and declaring a Jihad, by shaking off the British influence and dominance, the Shah can be acclaimed Emperor of India, his rightful title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mycenaean_excavations_desc;Mycenaean Greece was the last phase of the Bronze Age in Ancient Greece, spanning the period from approximately 1600�1100 BC. It represents the first advanced civilization in mainland Greece, with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art and writing system. \n\nThe Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, the Linear B, offers the first written records of the Greek language and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon.\n\nMycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax. Mycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ottoman_national_anthemn_desc;The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the Mahmudiye Marsi.\n\nLike in many other monarchies of its time, the anthem of the Ottoman Empire was an imperial anthem, not a national one. Hence it paid homage to a specific ruler and a new anthem was composed at each imperial succession.

The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor�s summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov�s gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia.

privatise_farms_desc;State farms, began to be created in the early 1920s as an ideological example of �socialist agriculture of the highest order�. Kolkhozes or collective farms were regarded for a long time as an intermediate stage in the transition to the ideal of state farming. While kolkhozy were typically created by combining small individual farms together in a cooperative structure, a sovkhoz would be organised by the state on land confiscated from former large estates and sovkhoz workers would be recruited from among landless rural residents.

The Commission ultimately purchased 613 estates from German owners and 214 from Poles, functioning to bail out German debtors often rather than fulfilling its declared national mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

reforms_of_abdul_hamid_ii_desc;Abdul Hamid II was the 34th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He oversaw a period of decline, with rebellions, particularly in the Balkans, he suspended both the Ottoman constitution and Parliament in $YEAR$ and accomplished highly effective power and control. \n\nModernisation of the Ottoman Empire occurred during his reign, including reform of the bureaucracy, the extension of the Rumelia Railway and Anatolia Railway and the construction of the Baghdad Railway and Hejaz Railway. In addition, a system for population registration and control over the press was established along with the first local modern law school in 1898. The most far-reaching of these reforms were in education: many professional schools were established, including Law School, School of Arts, School of Trades, Civil Engineering School, The Veterinarian School, The Customs School, The Farming School, The Linguistic School, and more.\n\nAbdul Hamid II attached utmost importance to the reorganization of the military. As early as 1880 he sought, and two years later secured, German assistance, which culminated in the appointment of Lt. Col. Kohler and, finally, Colmar Von der Goltz as military advisors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

reforms_of_abdulmejid_i_desc;Sultan Abdulmejid I enjoyed several years of peace, which enabled him to form a powerful and well-disciplined army that was established at the beginning of the year $YEAR$.\n\nThe chain-of-command in the general staff of each army was composed of a commander-in-chief, two lieutenant-generals, three brigadiers of infantry, one of whom commands the reserve, two brigadiers of cavalry, and one brigadier of artillery. In each corps there were three regiments of infantry, two of cavalry, and one of artillery, with thirty-three guns. The total strength of these twelve regiments of active forces was 30,000 men, but it was diminished in time of peace by furlough to an effective strength of about 25,000 men in three of the six armies, as well as 15,000 troops in the other three, a consequence of the recruiting system being as yet incomplete in its application all over the Ottoman Empire. The whole establishment of this branch amounts, therefore, to 180,000 men, belonging to the active service, but its effective strength is at present 123,000.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

repeal_the_corn_laws_desc;The �Corn Laws� were a series of vastly unpopular tariffs, often described as a rare example of British mercantilism, designed to �protect� British farmers and corn prices from cheap foreign competition, which, naturally, had the effect of effectively increasing corn prices for Britain�s poor. After the failed harvest of 1845, and the following Potato Famine in Ireland, the Corn Laws were finally repealed in 1846. The failure of these tariffs heralded a long period of British commitment to the ideals of Laissez-faire capitalism, that was to last for most of the 19th century.;Les 'lois sur le grain' regroupaient une s�rie de droits de douanes tr�s impopulaires, souvent d�crites comme un rare exemple de mercantilisme britannique, con�ues pour 'prot�ger' les fermiers anglais et les prix du bl� de la concurrence �trang�re, ce qui, naturellement, avait pour effet d'augmenter les prix du bl� pour les plus pauvres. Apr�s la mauvaise r�colte de 1845 et la Grande Famine irlandaise, les lois sur le grain finirent par �tre abrog�es en 1846. L'�chec de ces droits de douane marqua le d�but d'une longue p�riode d'engagement britannique � l'�gard des id�aux du capitalisme laxiste qui allait perdurer pendant presque tout le XIXe si�cle.;Die 'Korngesetze' waren eine Reihe �u�erst unbeliebter Zollabgaben, die oft als seltenes Beispiel f�r britischen Merkantilismus beschrieben wurden. Mit diesen Einfuhrz�llen sollte die britische Landwirtschaft vor der billigen ausl�ndischen Konkurrenz 'gesch�tzt' werden, aber nat�rlich erh�hte dies den Armen Englands nur die Kornpreise. Nach der Missernte von 1845 und der darauf folgenden Kartoffel-Hungersnot in Irland wurden die Korngesetze 1846 endlich aufgehoben. Das Scheitern dieser Z�lle leite eine lange Periode britischer Verbundenheit mit den Idealen des Laissez Faire-Kapitalismus ein, die den Gro�teil des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts �berspannte.;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Treaty of Paucarpata agreed to the devolution of all captured ships by Chile, the restoration of commercial relations between the Confederation and Chile, the withdrawal of all Chilean troops from Confederate territories and the payment by the Confederacy of the former Peruvian foreign debts with Chile. The Chilean troops were reembarked. When Admiral Blanco Encalada returned rather ignominiously to Valpara�so with the fleet and the army in December, 1837, the scandal was gigantic. The Chilean government and the Chilean public opinion repudiated the treaty in indignation. Admiral Blanco Encalada as was thrown into jail and tried for high treason, together with his advisor Antonio Jos� de Irisarri, who had refused to even return to Chile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ric_reorganize_desc;The first organised police forces in Ireland came about through the Peace Preservation Act in 1814 for which Sir Robert Peel (1788-1850) was largely responsible and the Irish Constabulary Act in 1822 formed the provincial constabularies. The 1822 Act established a force in each province with chief constables and inspectors general under the civil administration for Ireland controlled by the Dublin Castle administration. \n\nThe original force had been reorganised under The Act of 1836, and the first constabulary code of regulations was published in 1837. The discipline was strict and the pay low. The police faced civil unrest among the Irish rural poor, and was involved in bloody confrontations during the period of the Tithe War. Other deployments were against organisations like the Ribbonmen, which attacked landlords, their property and stock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The system of military education was also reformed, and elementary education was made available to all the draftees. \n\nMilyutin�s reforms are regarded as a milestone in the history of Russia: they dispensed with the military recruitment and professional army introduced by Peter the Great and created the Russian army such as it continued into the 21st century.

Er entwickelte sich im Laufe der Zeit zu einem wichtigen Handelshafen und Werftstandort f�r Russland. Schlie�lich wurde Wladiwostok zum Mittelpunkt einer interkontinentalen Eisenbahnstrecke sowie zu einem eigenst�ndigen Wissenschafts-, Kultur- und Industriezentrum. Der Zar tr�umte davon, dass die Stadt der Hauptverbindungspunkt zwischen Ost und West werden w�rde.

russification_of_finland_desc;Having enjoyed prosperity and control over their own affairs, and having remained loyal subjects for nearly a century, the manifesto which the $MONARCHTITLE$ issued on $YEAR$ was cause for Finnish despair. The manifesto was forced through the Finnish senate by the deciding vote of the senate president, an appointee of the $MONARCHTITLE$-and after the governor-general of Finland, Nikolay Bobrikov, had threatened a military invasion and siege. While ostensibly affirming the Finns� rights in purely local matters, the manifesto asserted the authority of the state in any and all matters which could be considered to �come within the scope of the general legislation of the empire�. The main policies enacted were:\nThe conscription law, incorporating the Finnish army into the imperial army.\nThe Language Manifesto of $YEAR$ which made Russian the language of administration of Finland.\nThe Orthodox Russian Church was the church of state, including, for example, criminalizing the act of subjecting a follower of the Orthodox church to a Lutheran church service.\nThe Manifesto of $YEAR$ which asserted the imperial government�s right to rule Finland without the consent of local legislative bodies, including press censorship and restrictions of Russian currency and stamps as the only ones allowed.\nOur Finnish subjects will surely not like this and they might try to resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

russify_baltic_states_desc;The Russian press took up the topic of German influence in the Baltic provinces. As early as the 1860s, the Slavophiles demanded the end of the autonomy in the Baltic provinces and a standardized administration. The unification of Germany and its subsequent development into a Great Power considerably increased the military-strategic importance of the Estonian and Latvian territories which bordered the Baltic Sea, between the extensively autonomous Finland and the rebellious Poland-Lithuania. The security of the capital St Petersburg became a serious issue for the Russian Empire. Tsarist Russia�s government circles were afraid of the Baltic German�s possible orientation towards Germany, especially worrying was the thought that by Germanizing the Estonians and Latvians, the Germans could become the majority nation in the Baltics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shinbutsu_bunri_desc;The Japanese term shinbutsu bunri indicates the separation of Shinto from Buddhism, introduced after the Meiji Restoration, and therefore the separation of kami (native Shinto deities) from Buddhas (Buddhist deities), and of Buddhist temples from Shinto shrines (jinja). Until the end of the Edo period Shinto and Buddhism were intimately connected in what was called shinbutsu-shugo, to the point that the same buildings were often used as both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, and Shinto gods were interpreted as manifestations of Buddhas. The new government saw shinbutsu bunri as a way to reduce the immense wealth and power of the Buddhist sects. At the same time, it was supposed to give Shinto, and especially its cult of the Emperor, time to grow into an effective vehicle for nationalism. A first order issued by the Jingijimuka on $YEAR$ ordered the defrocking of shaso and betto (shrine monks performing Buddhist rites at Shinto shrines). A few days later, the Daijokan banned the application of Buddhist terminology such as gongen to Japanese kami and the veneration of Buddhist statues in shrines. Next came a ban on applying the Buddhist term Daibosatsu (Great Bodhisattva) to the syncretic kami Hachiman at the Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu and Usa Hachiman-gu shrines. In the final stage, all the defrocked betto and shaso were told to become �shrine priests� (kannushi) and return to their shrines. Also, monks of the Nichiren sect were told not to refer to some deities as kami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

singapore_strategy_desc;The Singapore strategy was a naval defence policy of the British Empire that evolved in a series of war plans from 1919 to 1941. It aimed to deter aggression by the Empire of Japan by providing for a base for a fleet of the Royal Navy in the Far East, able to intercept and defeat a Japanese force heading south towards India or Australia. To be effective it required a well-equipped base;Singapore, at the eastern end of the Strait of Malacca, was chosen in 1919 as the location of this base;work continued on this naval base and its defences over the next two decades. The planners envisaged that a war with Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms.;;;;;;;;;;;x

support_french_foreign_legion_desc;�La L�gion �trang�re�, known in English as �The Foreign Legion�, is military unit of the French army, with a unique distinction in that it accepts its recruits regardless of their national and personal backgrounds. While originally established as early as 1830, the Legion did not win the lasting legacy it enjoys today until it had seen action during, among others, The Spanish Carlist Wars, The French Intervention in Mexico, the Battle of Camar�n, the Franco-Prussian war and, in fact, almost every conflict involving France up until and through the modern era. The image of the young man, perhaps on the run from some personal tragedy, oppression, debt or a criminal past, who joins the French Foreign Legion to serve a tour of personal redemption in the deserts of French Algeria, has since become one of the most iconic and enduring images of the 19th century. Promote the Legion, and see recruits flock to our banners.;La L�gion �trang�re est une unit� militaire de l'arm�e fran�aise qui se distingue par le recrutement de ses membres quelles que soient leur nationalit� ou leur histoire personnelle. Initialement form�e dans les ann�es 1830, la L�gion �trang�re gagna v�ritablement ses galons lors des guerres espagnoles carlistes, de l'intervention fran�aise au Mexique, de la bataille de Camar�n, de la guerre franco-prusse ainsi que pratiquement tous les conflits impliquant la France et ce, jusqu'� nos jours. L'image du jeune homme, peut-�tre en proie � une trag�die personnelle, � une oppression, � une dette ou � un pass� criminel, qui rejoint la L�gion �trang�re en guise de r�demption dans les d�serts de l'Alg�rie fran�aise, est l'une des images les plus symboliques du XIXe si�cle. Promouvez la L�gion et accueillez de nouvelles recrues sous nos drapeaux.;La L�gion �trang�re' ist der franz�sische Ausdruck f�r die 'Fremdenlegion', eine Einheit der franz�sischen Armee. Sie ist einzigartig dahingehend, dass sie Rekruten aus allen Nationen und pers�nlichen Hintergr�nden akzeptiert. Die Fremdenlegion wurde urspr�nglich im Jahr 1830 gegr�ndet, aber ihren heutigen Ruf erk�mpfte sie sich erst durch Eins�tze in den spanischen Karlistenkriegen, bei der franz�sischen Intervention in Mexiko, der Schlacht von Camar�n, dem deutsch-franz�sischen Krieg und eigentlich fast jedem anderen Konflikt Frankreichs. Die Vorstellung von einem jungen Mann, der vielleicht vor einer pers�nlichen Trag�die, Unterdr�ckung, Schulden oder einer kriminellen Vergangenheit flieht und der franz�sischen Fremdenlegion beitritt, um durch seinen Dienst in den W�sten des franz�sischen Algeriens seine pers�nliche Erl�sung zu finden, ist seither zu einer der ikonischsten und dauerhaftesten des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts geworden.

tanzimat_reforms_desc;�Tanzimat� Turkish for �reorganization� was a series of reforms enacted by the Ottoman state during the latter half of the 19th century, designed to counteract the rising tides of nationalism among the Empire�s vast and varied ethnic minorities. The reforms aimed at integrating the various populations under the common banner of �Ottomanism�, by promoting the Ottoman state as an alternative to the ethnicity-based nation states that many of the radicalized minorities within the state were, at the time, seeking to establish, and by granting increased representation and autonomy within the state. While the Tanzimat was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the decline of the Ottoman state, it can nevertheless be argued that the reforms at least postponed it.;Les r�formes de 'Tanzimat', le mot turc qui signifie 'r�organisation', furent adopt�es par l'�tat ottoman, au cours de la seconde moiti� du XIXe si�cle, en r�action contre la mont�e du nationalisme au sein des diverses minorit�s ethniques de l'empire. Ces r�formes visaient � int�grer la population sous la banni�re commune d'Ottomanisme en promouvant l'�tat ottoman comme alternative � l'ethnicit� bas�e sur les �tats de la nation que bon nombre de minorit�s radicales, au sein m�me de l'empire, cherchaient � �tablir, et en y accordant une repr�sentation et une autonomie plus large. Alors que les r�formes de 'Tanzimat' ne parvinrent pas � pr�venir le d�clin de l'�tat ottoman, force est de constater qu'elles le retard�rent.;'Tanzimat' ist T�rkisch f�r 'Neuorganisation'. So wurde eine Reihe von Reformen bezeichnet, die der osmanische Staat w�hrend des zweiten H�lfte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts auf den Weg brachte, um den steigenden Nationalismusgef�hlen der zahlreichen und unterschiedlichen ethnischen Minderheiten des Reichs entgegen zu wirken. Die Reformen zielten auf die Integration der verschiedenen Bev�lkerungen unter dem gemeinsamen Banner des 'Osmanismus' ab, indem der osmanische Staat als Alternative f�r die auf Volkszugeh�rigkeit basierenden Nationalstaaten pr�sentiert wurde, die viele der radikalisierten Minderheiten damals bilden wollten. Die Hauptargumente waren dabei eine st�rkere Repr�sentation und Autonomie innerhalb des osmanischen Staats. W�hrend die Tanzimat den Niedergang des osmanischen Reichs nicht verhindern konnte, so z�gerten ihn die Reformen zumindest etwas hinaus.;;;;;;;;;;;x

tasmania_penal_colony_desc;In 1803 the island south of Australia was colonized by the British as a penal colony with the name Van Diemen�s Land, and became part of the British colony of New South Wales. Male convicts served their sentences as assigned labour to free settlers or in gangs assigned to public works. Only the most difficult convicts (mostly re-offenders) were sent to the Tasman Peninsula prison known as Port Arthur. Female convicts were assigned as servants in free settler households or sent to a female factory (women�s workhouse prison). There were five female factories in Van Diemen�s Land. Convicts completing their sentences or earning their ticket-of-leave often promptly left Van Diemen�s Land. Many settled in the new free colony of Victoria, to the dismay of the free settlers in towns such as Melbourne.\n\nWe can abolish the penal colony and convert the island to a regular colony. Changing the name to Tasmania from Van Diemen�s Land should help our government to clear a little bit of the stigma that the island has.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tea_in_georgia_desc;Konstantin Popov, a wealthy merchant in charge of almost the entire Russian imperial tea trade, became interested in the idea of growing tea along the Black Sea coast. He bought vast plots in Chakvi, not far from Batumi, and dreamt of establishing massive plantations with internationally�competitive exports. In 1892, he travelled to China in order to study large-scale tea production. Popov hired a team of experienced workers from a factory in Guangdong, including an ambitious director named Lao Junzhou.

thai_constitution_desc;The Rattanakosin Kingdom and the four traditionally counted preceding kingdoms, collectively called Siam, had an uncodified constitution until $YEAR$. In the preamble to the Penal Code King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) stated: �In the ancient times the monarchs of the Siamese nation governed their people with laws which were originally derived from the Dhamasustra of Manu, which was then the prevailing law among the inhabitants of India and the neighbouring countries.\n\nThe constitution continued to state that sovereign power belonged to the people of Siam. However, unlike the temporary charter, the monarchy would now be the direct exerciser of that power, rather than the branches of government. This royal power would be exercised by and with the advice and consent of the People�s Assembly, the State Council (the cabinet), and the courts. However, the monarchy lacked any say in the composition of any of the branches of government and the royal veto could still be overruled. The monarchy was also made �sacred and inviolable�, in contrast to the temporary charter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_1854_plan_desc;Born into a lower-middle-class family in Lille, Louis Faidherbe is a sub-director of engineers in the colonies of Senegal. He plays a central role in the implementation of �The Plan of $YEAR$�: a series of ministerial orders given to Governor Protet of Senegal that originated in petitions from the powerful Boudreaux-based Maurel and Prom company, the largest shipping interest in Saint-Louis. The plan specified in detail the creation of forts along the S�n�gal River to end African control of the acacia gum trade from the interior. Faidherbe�s push to build fortifications farther out generated conflicts with Protet, and his protests to Paris over Protet�s inaction quickly awarded him some sympathy in the government. If we were to appoint him to chef de bataillon and then governor of the colony, we could quickly put the plan in action and take control of the coastal Wolof kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

During the 1820s, the Sultanate of Aceh became a regional political and commercial power, supplying half of the world�s pepper, which increased the revenues and influence of local feudal rajahs. Following the opening of the Suez Canal, the trade routes shifted and we are now in a position to strike a deal with the civilized protectors of the Aceh: allow us a free hand within their sphere of influence in Maritime Southeast Asia while we also take the responsibility to fight piracy in the region.

the_case_of_edgardo_mortara_desc;Edgardo Mortara was born to Jewish parents in Bologna in 1851. During a period of illness in 1857, a Catholic servant girl of the Mortara family baptized Edgardo, for fear that he might otherwise, as a non-Christian, go to Hell if he died. On the basis of this baptism, the Papal States� police took Edgardo away from his family, and had him raised as a Roman Catholic, as non-Christians were, according to Papal States� law, forbidden to raise Christian children, even their own. The case, or kidnapping, caused an international uproar, and was protested by, among others, Napoleon III, Emperor Franz Josef and The London Times. Mortara himself would go on to become a Catholic priest, and resumed contact with his siblings and mother in his later life.;Edgardo Mortara est n� de parents juifs � Bologne en 1851. En 1857, alors qu'il �tait malade, une servante catholique de la famille Mortara fit baptiser Edgardo de peur qu'il meure et aille en enfer parce qu'il n'�tait pas chr�tien.

Though the Army was only active for a few years, from 1860 to 1864, it was instrumental in putting down the Taiping Rebellion. It was the first Chinese army which was trained in European techniques, tactics, and strategy. As such, it became a model for later Chinese armies. \n\n The Ever-Victorious Army numbered around 5,000 soldiers at its height. It often defeated rebel forces which were numerically much larger because it was better armed, better commanded, and better trained.

the_pacific_reclamation_desc;The claims of the Viceroyalty of New Spain extended all the way to the 61st parallel and included much of the lands later taken by the British, Russians and Americans. These claims were only given up by Spain in 1819 with the Treaty of Adams-On�s. Mexico was only party to this treaty in 1828 under duress from the United States. When they recognized the independence of the Tejano rebels in 1836, they broke this treaty, and as such we are in no obligation to follow it either.

the_xiang_army_desc;The Xiang Army was a standing army organized by Zeng Guofan from existing regional and village militia forces called tuanlian to contain the Taiping rebellion. The Army was financed through local nobles and gentry, as opposed to the centralized Manchu-led Qing dynasty. \n\nAlthough it was raised specifically to address problems in Hunan, the Army formed the core of the new Qing military establishment, and as such, forever weakened the Manchu influence within the military. This devolution of centralized command is commonly pointed to as a major reason for the eventual downfall of the Qing and the emergence of regional warlord-ism in China during the first half of the twentieth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

thesaphiban_reforms_desc;Before the thesaphiban reforms, Siam consisted of partially independent cities called mueang, some directly subordinate to the capital, some subordinate to larger mueang, or to one or more of the tributary kingdoms. Before the reforms, governors inherited their posts from their family lineage, and lived on taxes they collected in their area, a practice formally called tax farming. These were converted from hereditary governors to appointed governmental posts, as had been done by Chinese Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era rulers in first recognizing Tusi (tribal leaders) as imperial officials, then replacing them with imperial appointees. The arrangement resulted in governors being appointed and paid by the central government, and mueang developed into provinces. \n\nResistance to these reforms would cause uprisings by traditional local leaders around the Kingdom for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The gwageo system was abolished and replaced by a Japanese bureaucratic system. The administration of financial affairs were centralized, the taxation system redressed, a new monetary system allowed the use of Japanese currency, and the measurement system was changed to that of Japan�s. Other social reforms were addressed as well: discrimination based on the class system, slavery, underage marriage were all banned and widows were granted the right to remarry.

torching_of_the_summer_palace_desc;The Old Summer Palace, known in Chinese as the Gardens of Perfect Brightness, was a complex of gardens northwest of the Imperial City in Beijing, China. The gardens were built in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and functioned as a place of residence for the Qing Emperors. The Old Summer Palace was burnt to the ground by Anglo-French forces during their occupation of Beijing during the Second Opium War. While the torching was a major blow to Chinese morale, it was also decried by many European intellectuals, Victor Hugo among others, as a criminal act of brutality directed against the Chinese. By burning this exquisite piece of Chinese cultural history, we can inflict a massive blow on Chinese morale.;L'ancien Palais d'�t�, connu en chinois sous le nom des Jardin de l'intelligence parfaite, abritait un vaste parc situ� au nord-est de la Cit� imp�riale de P�kin, en Chine.

turkish_tea_desc;Turkish tea, called �ay, is an important part of Turkish culture. Offering tea to guests is part of Turkish hospitality though tea is most often consumed in households, shops and mostly kiraathane, which is social congregation of Turkish men. Turkish tea is typically prepared using two stacked kettles called ��aydanlik� specially designed for tea preparation. Water is brought to a boil in the larger lower kettle and then some of the water is used to fill the smaller kettle on top and steep (infuse) several spoons of loose tea leaves, producing a very strong tea. Despite the growing popularity of tea in $COUNTRY$, there are no tea producing provinces in our homeland. Now the microclimate region along the eastern coast of the Black Sea was identified by specialists as an ideal spot to start tea production, which will contribute to the task of fulfilling the growing demand for tea by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. However, this knowledge is kept largely a secret by the British and they are bound to be dissatisfied if we start our own tea production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

von_moltkes_staff_reforms_desc;In 1857 Helmuth von Moltke was appointed Chief of the Prussian General Staff, which he soon set about reforming.

The end result was that, by the time of the Franco-Prussian war, Prussia�s General Staff was considered the most efficient in Europe, it�s methods soon becoming widely studied and adopted abroad. Moltke remained Chief of the Prussian Staff for the next 30 years, and is known as one of the most brilliant military strategists of the 19th century.;En 1857, Helmut von Moltke fut nomm� Chef de l��tat-major de la Prusse, qu�il entreprit bient�t de r�former.
