1850_compromise_desc;Senators Henry Clay and Stephen A. Douglas have presented a draft proposal for a compromise on the slavery issue centred around the premise of popular sovereignty as the determinant for slavery or abolitionism in the territories. By supporting the draft proposal, we could calm tensions over the slavery issue for at least some time. The compromise is a package of five separate bills which will defuse a four-year political confrontation between slave and free states regarding the status of territories acquired during the Mexican-American War. The mains points are:\n1. Texas surrenders its claim to New Mexico, over which it had threatened war, as well as its claims north of the Missouri Compromise Line. It retains the Texas Panhandle and the federal government will took over the state’s public debt.\n2. California is admitted as a free state with its current boundaries.\n3.The Wilmot Proviso will be fully rejected.\n4.The slave trade (but not slavery altogether) will be banned in Washington D.C.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

abolish_los_fueros_desc;The relentless centralizing drive of the Spanish Crown led, after the end of the First Carlist War, to the reduction of the Basque institutional and legal system (called Fueros), but it was only after the last Carlist War that it was virtually wiped out. After the war, a new Spanish constitution was drawn up in order to establish a unitarian and central administration in Spain cut out according to a Spanish-Castilian pattern. Navarre was affected, but for the moment it was spared from further curtailments due to their 1841 ‘Compromise Act’ (Ley Paccionada) that turned officially the semi-autonomous Kingdom of Navarre into another province of Spain. The Basques were forced to enrol in the Spanish military on an individual basis, and not in separate groups or corps, despite the fact that many Basques could hardly articulate a pair of phrases in Spanish, exposing them at best to stressful experiences. These changes allowed Spain to turn in a modern unified country, shaking off the last bits of the Ancien Régime, the first step to end the regionalism driving the forces behind the Carlists and Christinos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

abolish_serfdom_desc;The institution of serfdom—unfree farm labour tied to the land of a local noble, effectively a form of feudal slavery—had existed in various forms in Russia since the Kievan Rus of the 11th century. Throughout the ages the institution had undergone several reforms and changes, but the first steps toward a complete abolishment were taken only in the 1810s, when the institution was abolished in the Russian domains of Kurland, Estonia and Livonia. The institution was only abolished in all of Russia with the agrarian reform of 1861, during the reign of Tsar Alexander II, who at the time feared that the Russian peasantry might otherwise seek their liberation through outright revolution.;Le système de servage, une main-d'œuvre privée de liberté rattachée aux terres d'un noble local, une forme d'esclavage féodal, a existé en Russie depuis la Rus' de Kiev du XIe siècle. Au fil du temps, ce système a fait l'objet de plusieurs réformes et évolutions, mais les premières mesures d'abolition ne furent prises que dans les années 1810, époque à laquelle il fut aboli dans les domaines russes du Kurland, d'Estonie et de Livonie. Il fallut attendre la réforme agraire de 1861 pour voir l'abolition totale de ce système, sous le règne du tsar Alexandre II qui craignait, à l'époque, un soulèvement de la paysannerie russe.;Die Einführung der Leibeigenschaft—unfreie Landarbeit auf den Ländereien eines lokalen Adligen, also eine Art feudaler Sklaverei—hatte in Russland seit der Kiewer Rus im elften Jahrhundert in verschiedenen Formen existiert. Im Laufe der wurde die Leibeigenschaft mehreren Reformen und Veränderungen unterworfen, aber erste Schritte in Richtung einer vollständigen Abschaffungen wurden erst in den 1810er Jahren unternommen, als die Leibeigenschaft in den russischen Domänen Kurland, Estland und Livland abgeschafft wurde. Im restlichen Russland wurde sie erst während der Herrschaft von Zar Alexander II. im Zuge der Agrarreform von 1861 abgeschafft. Der Zar befürchtete damals, dass sich die russischen Bauern ansonsten ihre Freiheit durch eine offene Revolution holen würden.;;;;;;;;;;;x

abolish_slavery_desc;Slavery is legal in our nation, but no slaves are found in our fields. With slavery becoming rarer and rarer in the world, the more liberal and abolitionist sectors of our society could gain enough power to pass a bill in the UH, arguing that ‘abolishing this outdated institution from our country will elevate our us in the eyes of the civilized nations’. With a little push from the $MONARCHTITLE$, this new bill can become a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
abolish_slavery_romania_desc;The earliest law which freed a category of slaves was in March 1843 in Wallachia, which transferred the control of the state slaves owned by the prison authority to the local authorities, leading to their sedentarisation and becoming peasants. A year later, in 1844, Moldavian Prince Mihail Sturdza proposed a law on the freeing of slaves owned by the church and state. \n\nIn 1847, in Wallachia, a law of Prince Gheorghe Bibescu adopted by the Divan freed the slaves owned by the church and the rest of the slaves owned by the state institutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In exchange for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection, the rulers of the constituent territories of the Protectorate agreed not to enter into treaties with or cede territory to any other foreign power. For administrative purposes, the protectorate was informally divided into the Eastern Protectorate (with its own Political Officer, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ advisor, stationed at Mukalla in Qu’aiti) and the Western Protectorate (with its own Political Officer, stationed at Lahej), for some separation of administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Originally written as a poem by C.J. Langehoven in 1918, the piece had music composed for it in 1921 by Marthinus Lourens de Villiers. ‘Die Stem’ saw frequent use in the broadcasts of the African Broadcasting Company, which played it at the end of daily broadcasts, along with God Save the King.

alaskan_purchase_desc;After the events of the Crimean War Russia had begun believing that it could not hope to protect its North American possessions in the event of another war with Britain, and had begun considering a sale of what was to become the U.S. state of Alaska. The territory was bought by the United States in 1867 at the price of 2.3 cents per acre. The Alaska purchase was widely derided in the American press of the day as ‘Seward’s Icebox’ after then Secretary of State William H. Seward, at whose initiative the purchase was made.;"Après les événements de la guerre de Crimée, la Russie comprit qu'il ne lui serait plus possible de protéger ses possessions nord-américaines si une autre guerre venait à éclater avec le Royaume-Uni et commença à vendre ce qui allait devenir l'État américain d'Alaska. En 1867, les États-Unis acquirent ce territoire au prix de 2,3 cents l'acre.

Alexander hoped that agricultural production could be modernized and made more efficient by eliminating the last remnants of serfdom. This would assist the transformation of Russia from a backward agricultural economy into a modern industrial and capitalist economy. More urgently, Alexander agreed to other liberalizations of Russian society. Among these were the creation of representative bodies called zemstva, in effect a form of local government in villages and provinces, given authority to dispense education, charitable relief and other services. The ‘reformer tzar’ also ordered the reformation of the army and navy, the implementation of new legal processes and an overhaul of the penal code.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In early May 1908 D’Arcy, having sunk more than 500,000 pounds into their Persian venture and found no oil, sent a telegram saying that they had run out of money and ordering to ‘cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost and come home’.

banjarmasin_war_desc;Since 1606 the East United India Company maintained contacts with the island of Borneo. In 1635 the first contract was signed with the Sultanate of Banjarmasin for the provision of pepper—at the time, a luxury product in Europe and a major reason for the Dutch interest in this region. Over the years, effective power in the Sultanate was increasingly taken up by the Dutch Resident.\n\nIn 1852 the Sultan’s heir-apparent died, and the Dutch replaced him by the illegitimate grandson Tamjied Illah. In vain, Sultan Adam and many nobles sent an emissary to Batavia, pointing out iniquities perpetrated by the Dutch-designated heir and appealing for the Dutch to recognise instead Hidayatullah—a younger but legitimate son.\n\nSultan Adam soon died and was succeeded by the illegitimate Tamjied Illah. There ensued a struggle for power between Tamjied Illah and Hidayatullah, which divided the population, much of which stood behind Hidayatullah and highly resented the Dutch sponsoring of Tamjied Illah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The country’s economic and strategic strength was buttressed by the fleet, localized military action was a staple of the not-entirely-peaceful ‘Pax Britannica’. In addition, the threat of naval force was a significant factor in diplomacy. \n\nDuring the late 19th century, Britain’s primary goal in foreign policy was to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to intervene if that balance was upset. Its secondary goal was to protect its overseas interest in the colonies and dominions, as free trade kept the Empire alive. The sea routes to the colonies, especially those linking Britain to India were vital. \n\n§RNOTE: This will cause Britain to reject all alliances with great powers unless it is threatened by another rising great power.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As such the Majles is a threat to both the authority of the Shah and the ability of foreigners to control Persian affairs. Perhaps we should ‘reign it in.’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bring_tea_to_iran_desc;After a failed attempt to cultivate tea in $COUNTRY$ in 1882 with seeds from India, Prince Mohammad Mirza known as ‘Kashef Al Saltaneh’ who was born in Lahijan, imported Indian tea and started its cultivation in Lahijan. Kashef, who was the first mayor of Tehran and an Iranian ambassador to India under British rule, knew that the British would not allow him to learn about the secrets of tea production, as it was it is their biggest business in India. So being fluent in French, the prince pretended to be a French labourer and started to work in the tea plantations and factories to learn how to produce tea. Ultimately his plan was to take back some samples of this tea to $COUNTRY$ to cultivate. He was successful in this endeavour only because of his diplomatic immunity which stopped the British from searching his secretly stashed sample. At the time, Kashef brought 3000 saplings into his country from the Northern part of India, Kangra and he started the cultivation in the region Gilan, south of the Caspian Sea. The climate there was well suited for tea cultivation, and the tea industry quickly expanded in Gilan and Mazanderan region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Over the course of the 19th century this involvement gradually increased. The colonial government was, in particular, interested in fostering trade as this provided it with its main source of revenue, in the form of customs duties and other taxes.

build_high_speed_rail_desc;High-speed rail (HSR) is a type of rail transport that operates significantly faster than traditional rail traffic, using an integrated system of specialised rolling stock and dedicated tracks. While there is no single standard that applies worldwide, new lines in excess of 250 kilometres per hour (160 mph) and existing lines in excess of 200 kilometres per hour (120 mph) are widely considered to be high-speed. The first high-speed rail system, the Tokaido Shinkansen, began operations in Japan in 1964 and was widely known as the bullet train. High-speed trains normally operate on standard gauge tracks of continuously welded rail on grade-separated right-of-way that incorporates a large turning radius in its design.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Originally designed as turbotrains to be powered by gas turbines, TGV prototypes evolved into electric trains with the 1973 oil crisis. In 1976 the SNCF ordered 87 high-speed trains from GEC-Alsthom. Following the inaugural service between Paris and Lyon in 1981 on the LGV Sud-Est, the network, centred on Paris, has expanded to connect major cities across France and in neighbouring countries on a combination of high-speed and conventional lines.

A puppet Emperor of the dynasty was enthroned in Gonder by one warlord, only to be dethroned and replaced by another member of the Imperial dynasty when a different warlord was able to seize Gonder and the reins of power. Regions such as Gojjam and Shewa were ruled by their own branches of the Imperial dynasty and, in Shewa, the local prince went as far as assuming the title of King. Now it’s our time to try and seize the moment, to claim the title of King, to march on Gonder and all of Ethiopia and to try and bring an end to the infighting, to make Ethiopia whole once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

clear_out_the_manchu_elite_desc;Since the beginning of the Qing dynasty, the Chinese Imperial administration and bureaucracy had been dominated by a powerful Manchu elite, and the Qing emperors had traditionally discriminated heavily against ethnic Han. In the 1860s, Empress Dowager Cixi effectively ended this practice, when she entrusted the country’s most powerful military unit to a man of Han background, Zeng Guofan, during the suppression of the Taiping rebellion. By getting rid of the Manchu elite, we can take an important step toward modernization.;Depuis le début de la dynastie Qing, l'administration et la bureaucratie de l'Empire chinois sont dominées par une puissante élite mandchoue et les empereurs Qing se sont attachés à discriminer l'ethnie Han. Dans les années 1860, l'impératrice Dowager Cixi mit fin à cette pratique et confia le commandement de la plus puissante unité militaire du pays à un homme d'origine Han, Zeng Guofan, au cours de la suppression de la rébellion Taiping. En nous débarrassant de l'élite mandchoue, nous pourrons faire un important pas en avant vers la modernisation.;Seit dem Beginn der Qing-Dynastie wurde die kaiserliche chinesische Verwaltung von einer mächtigen Mandschu-Elite dominiert, die die Han-Chinesen stets schwer diskriminierten.

These borders normally have fences or walls in which any gates or border crossings are closed and if these border gates are opened, they generally only allow movement of people in exceptional circumstances. In case of emigration as well as immigrations, departing ships are inspected for illegal emigrants. These controls and checks come at the cost of an increased demand from the State’s bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

collectivise_farms_desc;State farms, began to be created in the early 1920s as an ideological example of ‘socialist agriculture of the highest order’. Kolkhozes or collective farms were regarded for a long time as an intermediate stage in the transition to the ideal of state farming. While kolkhozy were typically created by combining small individual farms together in a cooperative structure, a sovkhoz would be organised by the state on land confiscated from former large estates and sovkhoz workers would be recruited from among landless rural residents. The sovkhoz employees would be paid regulated wages, whereas the remuneration system in a kolkhoz relied on cooperative-style distribution of farm earnings (in cash and in kind) among the members. In farms of both types, however, a system of internal passports prevented movement of employees and members from rural areas to urban areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After the permission and promised financial help, the Central-Dombauverein was founded in 1842.

colonization_of_fernando_po_desc;The king, with sufficient advance notice, prepared a reception for the visitors, the kind of reception only he could prepare. From the outskirts of the town to the palace of the mochucu, the street was lined with two long lines of Bubi warriors, daubed with red, with rifles and lances and holding buffalo-skin shields. They cheered for $COUNTRY$. At the end was the aged King Moka, standing next to his throne made of tree trunks. He still looked arrogant and for the reception he had, naturally, put on his best finery: the two-point full-dress hat of a marine official and an old frock coat, but without the trousers. The monkey skin apron hung from his waist, and in his right hand he flaunted his staff of command. To his right was Abba Moote, high priest of the Bubi, with his paddle in his hand, emblem of his dignity. To his left, his first lieutenant, Sas Ebuera. The elderly counsellors and the king’s sixty wives crowded after him. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag Moka had received as a gift waved over the palace door. After two days of conferences and after having exchanged the customary gifts and tightened the bonds between $COUNTRY$ and Moka, the visitors returned to Santa Isabel, not without the governor having granted the king permission to use gunpowder…\n\nThe island of Fernando Pó has been the stage of numerous colonization attempts by the Spanish and the British. The north of the island is home to its only European settlement, founded by the British as a base of operations to end the slave trade in the Atlantic. Despite that, expansion of the colonization efforts have been largely hampered by the Bubi people, unified in a monarchy under king Moka. After years of isolationism, the kingdom is opening up to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ advances and we now have the means to colonize the island, submitting the natives to the authority of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

complete_circassian_pacification_desc;The Caucasian War had been ongoing since 1817. Several major pacification campaigns had been launched against the Circassians, all of them unsuccessful. In 1858, Tsar Alexander II sent General Baryatinsky with overwhelming force into the region. Between 1858 and 1864 resistance was finally suppressed and the region pacified. Mass population expulsions and massacres occurred, many Circassians resettling in The Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

confiscations_of_mendizabal_desc;The Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal were a series of decrees issued between 1835 and -37 aimed at the privatization and expropriation of monastic land and property in Spain. Inspired by anticlerical liberalism, and the polarization of Spanish society during the events of The Carlist wars, the decrees led to the abandonment of many ancient Spanish monasteries.;Les confiscations ecclésiastiques de Mendizabal sont une série de décrets promulgués entre 1835 et 1837 visant à l’expropriation de terres et bâtiments monastiques en Espagne.

congo_mining_company_desc;Cheap copper has no terrors for the great Mid-African mines of the Mining Union of Upper Katanga, world’s biggest producer… Elements in Katanga’s strength are: tremendously rich ores, cheap native labour, big production of cobalt and radium (over 82%, of world radium supply) on the side and, most recent, the newly opened Benguela Railway, which connects Katanga with the Atlantic, saves hundreds of rail miles, thousands of nautical miles for Katanga copper on its long journey to European markets.\n\nA recent article published in a famous magazine talks about the riches of the Congo. Australian explorers found gold in the Angola river and the Ituri region, prospectors found diamonds in the Kananga region while copper, iron and other ores were found in Katanga. By founding a few mining companies such as the Mining Union of Upper Katanga, encouraging more exploration, settlement and exploitation of the Congo and by conceding incentives to the mining sector, both foreign and native, we will be able to better leverage profits out of the heart of the dark continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

court_yard_speech_desc;The ‘Courtyard Crisis’ (Swedish: Borggårdskrisen) was a constitutional crisis in Sweden provoked by the reckless cuts in the defence budget promoted by the Liberal government of, then prime minister, Karl Staaf. On the 6th of February 1914 King Gustav V addressed—with a rousing speech in favour of increased defence spending—a crowd of some 30.000 farmers who from every corner of the country had marched to Stockholm in support of King, Country and the Armed Forces. It was to be the last time that a Swedish Monarch interfered directly against the sacred principles of plebeian rule.;La «crise de la cour» (en suédois: Borggårdskrisen) est une crise constitutionnelle provoquée par les coupes importantes effectuées dans le budget militaire par le premier ministre libéral suédois de l’époque, Karl Staaf. Le 6 février 1914 le roi Gustav V s’adressa dans un discours enflammé en faveur de l’augmentation des dépenses militaires à près de 30000 fermiers venus des quatre coins du pays jusqu’à Stockholm pour soutenir le roi, le pays et les forces armées.

cover_the_senne_desc;The Senne River flows through the centre of Brussels. By 1860 the accumulation of waste in the river came to pose a significant health risk to the population. Residents preferred to move out of the city and live in the suburbs, thus depriving the city of tax revenues. In 1865 the architect Léon-Pierre Suys presented a plan to divert the Senne through specially constructed tunnels under the centre of the city. The exposed riverbed would be covered over and a series of 4 grand boulevards were to be laid out. Construction started in 1867 and was completed in 1871. While the new buildings failed to attract suburban residents back to the city, public health was measurably improved and transport congestion eased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

create_pakistan_desc;The movement for Muslim self-awakening and identity was started by the Muslim modernist and reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, considered the architect of the two-nation theory. The two-nation theory is the ideology that the primary identity and unifying denominator of Muslims in the South Asian subcontinent is their religion, rather than their language or ethnicity, and therefore Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations, regardless of ethnic or other commonalities. To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was ‘a complete social order which affects all the activities in life’ and ‘where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded’. By recognizing the Two-Nation Theory and the Muslim demand, we will open the path for them to create their own nation in the South Asian subcontinent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A launch system includes the launch vehicle, the launch pad, and other infrastructure. Although a carrier rocket’s payload is often an artificial satellite placed into orbit, some spaceflights, such as sounding rockets, are sub-orbital, while others enable spacecraft to escape Earth orbit entirely.

create_satellite_desc;In the context of spaceflight, a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth’s Moon. Approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-Earth orbit, 50 are in medium-Earth orbit (at 20,000 km), and the rest are in geostationary orbit (at 36,000 km). A few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit. Over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, a few asteroids, and the Sun. Satellites are used for many purposes. Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites, communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and space telescopes. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Satellite orbits vary greatly, depending on the purpose of the satellite, and are classified in a number of ways. Well-known (overlapping) classes include low Earth orbit, polar orbit, and geostationary orbit. Satellites are propelled by rockets to their orbits. Usually the launch vehicle itself is a rocket lifting off from a launch pad on land. Some satellites are launched at sea (from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform) or aboard a plane (see air launch to orbit). Satellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems. Satellite subsystems attend many tasks, such as power generation, thermal control, telemetry, attitude control and orbit control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

create_space_probe_desc;A robotic spacecraft is an un-crewed spacecraft, usually under telerobotic control. A robotic spacecraft designed to make scientific research measurements is often called a space probe. Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival, given current technology. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for human spaceflight by lack of major propulsion or landing systems.

It was named for French-Jewish lawyer and Minister of Justice Adolphe Cremieux, who had founded the Alliance Israelite Universelle a decade earlier. \n\n At the same time the naturalization regime in French Algeria was confirmed in Decree 137, determining that Muslims are not French citizens in the French colony of Algeria. The aim was to maintain the status quo, the sovereignty of France over its North African colonies. Five years later, in 1875, this was confirmed in the framework of the Code de l’indigenat. \n\n The decree allowed for native Jews to automatically become French citizens while Muslim Arabs and Berbers were excluded and remained under the second-class indigenous status outlined in the Code de l’Indigenat. They could, on paper, request French citizenship, but requests were very seldom accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

danmarks_riges_grundlov_desc;Denmark had been an absolute monarchy since 1660 when, on June fifth 1849, King Frederick VII signed the document known as ‘Danmarks Riges Grundlov’, The Danish Constitution, into law. The signing of a constitution delimiting the monarch’s power, a development which Fredericks predecessors had fought hard to avoid, came about during a period of Danish national unity, following the First Schleswig War. The constitution marks Denmark’s transition away from absolutism, and to a constitutional monarchy. Let us give our people a constitution!;"Le Danemark était dirigé par une monarchie absolue depuis 1660 lorsque, le 5 juin 1849, le roi Frederick VII signa un document connu sous le nom de ""Danmarks Riges Grundlov"" et correspondant à la constitution danoise.

das_zivilgesetzbuch_desc;The tenth Landtag (parliament) of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, in session between 1844-47, spent a fair amount of its time trying to amalgamate the Napoleonic Civil Code used in the province of Reinhessen, including Mainz, with the traditional German law applied throughout the rest of the Duchy. The result of these efforts was the publication of the ‘Zivilgesetzbuch’, The Book of Civil Law, in 1847, which effectively united all territories of the Duchy under one common source of law.;"Le dixième Landtag (parlement) du grand-duché de Hesse, en séance entre 1844 et 1847, passa le plus clair de son temps à tenter de fusionner le Code civil napoléonien utilisé dans la province de Hesse rhénane (qui incluait la ville de Mayence) et le droit allemand traditionnel appliqué dans le reste du duché.

declare_republic_of_neuchatel_desc;In 1707 Neuchâtel became a possession of Frederick the Great of Prussia by virtue of his maternal ties to the House of Orange-Nassau, and the principality thus effectively entered a personal union with the Kingdom of Prussia and the Hohenzollern family. During the Napoleonic wars, Prussia ceded Neuchâtel after the country’s defeat at the hands of Napoleon. After the Napoleonic wars, Neuchâtel was joined with Switzerland as the 21st canton thereof, at the suggestion of Frederick William III of Prussia, while at the same time also remaining a Prussian principality pro forma. In 1848, the province shook off its monarchical past, and was declared a republic within the Swiss Confederation. The Prussian claims were equitably relinquished in 1857.;En 1707, Neuchâtel tomba dans l'escarcelle de Frédéric le Grand de Prusse en vertu de ses liens maternels avec la Maison d'Orange-Nassau et la principauté forma une alliance personnelle avec le Royaume de Prusse et la famille Hohenzollern. Au cours des guerres napoléoniennes, la Prusse renonça à Neuchâtel après la défaite du pays contre Napoléon. Une fois ces guerres terminées, Neuchâtel rejoignit la Suisse en tant que 21e canton, sur proposition de Frédéric-Guillaume III de Prusse, tout en restant également une principauté prusse pro forma. En 1848, la province se débarrassa de son héritage monarchique et devint une république de la Confédération suisse. Les revendications prusses cessèrent en 1857.;Im Jahr 1707 ging Neuchâtel durch Beziehungen mütterlicherseits zum Haus Oranien-Nassau in den Besitz von Friedrich dem Großen von Preußen über. Das Fürsten ging also effektiv eine Personalunion mit dem Königreich Preußen und den Hohenzollern ein. Während der napoleonischen Kriege trat Preußen nach einer Niederlage gegen Napoleon ab. Nach den napoleonischen Kriegen wurde Neuchâtel auf Anregung von Friedrich Wilhelm III. von Preußen der Schweiz als 21. Kanton angeschlossen, obwohl es gleichzeitig auf dem Papier ein preußisches Fürstentum blieb. Im Jahr 1848 entledigte sich die Provinz ihrer monarchischen Vergangenheit und erklärte sich innerhalb der schweizerischen Konföderation zur Republik.

devil_island_desc;Le Bagne de Cayenne, Devil’s Island, was a famous prison of the 19th and 20th century which operated in the tropical colony of French Guiana. Opened in 1852, it was notorious for being used for internal exile of French political prisoners and the most hardened of thieves and murderers, but also for its harsh treatment—including diseases—of prisoners, deported here from all sides of the country. Only a small minority of broken survivors returned to France to tell how horrible it was;they sometimes scared other potential criminals to go straight. If the original sentence exceeded eight years, they were forced to stay as residents for the remainder of their lives and were provided land to settle on—helping populating the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In response to these events, the poet and merchant Max Schneckenburger wrote a patriotic poem calling on the ‘Fatherland to remain calm’, for, as the poem says, ‘fast and true stands the watch at the Rhine’, implying that the German nation would defend the river against any and all aggression. The poem was put to music in 1854, and became extremely popular in Germany during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

disolve_riau_lingga_desc;Throughout the 19th century, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule in the East Indies has placed more and more $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control over the Sultanate of Riau-Lingga. In $YEAR$, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ demanded a new agreement with the sultan, stipulating further limits on the powers of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, requiring that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag must be raised higher than the flag of Riau, and specifying that Dutch officials should be given supreme honour in the land.\n\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ insisted that the sultan sign the agreement, but after consulting the fellow rulers of the state, and other members of the ruling elite, he refused, and decided to form a military regiment under the leadership of the prince regent, Tengku Umar. During a visit of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Resident’s visit to Penyengat, the sultan then, on his own authority and without $COUNTRY_ADJ$ approval, summoned local Malay rulers, making the Resident feel as if he was being besieged by the sultanate. \n\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ is clear, this defiance by the sultan must be punished, the Riau-Lingga Sultanate must be dissolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dissolve_the_upper_house_desc;Supreme executive power in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state emanates from $CAPITAL$, through the figure of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch. The absolute monarch is the final authority in all matters of the state, but the bureaucracy and the military are the pillars that sustain the absolutist government. In addition, the landed aristocracy, which often acts as the bureaucracy, expects and receives positions of power in the government, positions appointed by the monarch. This is necessary for the normal function of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state—the aristocrats are the governor generals, the privy-councillors, the high-ranking bureaucrats, the ministers, the judges and the executors of the monarch’s decisions. For these functions, several government institutions exist and are populated by the landed nobility—the Committee of Ministers of $COUNTRY$, the Governing Senate, the State Council. They help draft and apply laws, manage foreign and internal policy, plan wars and administer the military, advise the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch as well as judge and administer justice. The monarch still can and has the final say in all these matters, and is his royal prerogative to do away the currently appointed aristocrats and pick new ones. By taking this step—effectively dissolving the upper house and appointing new ministers—the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch can surround himself with sycophants and petty nobility that are willing to do whatever he wants them to do—for a time, at least. This break in the unspoken agreement between the monarch and the bureaucrats, the monarch and the aristocracy, will bring consequences—besides exposing internal fractures in the government to the international community, it is sure to anger the nobles and sow confusion throughout the government ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

early_archaeology_desc;Archaeology is the study of human activity, primarily through the recovery and analysis of the material culture and environmental data that they have left behind, which includes artefacts, architecture, biofacts and cultural landscapes (the archaeological record). Study of human antiquity date back in the days of the Renaissance, but in the 19th century, Archaeology evolved to a real science. Archaeologists began to investigate various areas around the world, with the study of ancient Aegean civilization being stimulated by the excavations of Heinrich Schliemann at Troy, and of Arthur Evans at Crete, whilst John Lloyd Stephens was a pivotal figure in the rediscovery of Maya civilization throughout Central America. However, the methodologies employed by these archaeologists were highly flawed by the standards of the 20th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

embrace_the_boer_desc;The Dutch East Indies company rule in South Africa was tyrannical: they closed the colony against free immigration, kept the whole of the trade in its own hands, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers in one body, prescribed to the farmers the nature of the crops they were to grow, demanded from them a large part of their produce, and harassed them with other exactions tending to discourage industry and enterprise. The effect of this tyranny was inevitable: it drove men to desperation. They fled from oppression, and thus trekking began. The colony changed hands but many of the Boer farmers were as dissatisfied with British rule as they had been with the Dutch East India Company, though their ground of complaint was not the same. By making amends with the Boer farmers, paying compensation, abolishing Company rule and administrating the colonies directly, we can make amends and make the Boers accept our rule, to finally put an end to the trekking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

enact_female_suffrage_desc;The idea of Woman’s Suffrage increasingly gained traction in Western society throughout the 19th century. First advocated in the writings of early liberal philosophers, such as England’s Mary Wollstonecraft or John Stuart Mill, the idea and ideology of Woman’s Suffrage gradually developed, as the century wore on, into a coherent ideology in its own right: Feminism. The experience during The First World War, of women working in factories, and other jobs previously reserved for men during peacetime, is often said to have been a crucial pivot point in securing Woman’s right to work, vote, and, in other fields of society, achieve legal equality with men.;Au XIXe siècle, la question du droit de vote des femmes gagne de plus en plus de terrain. Initialement défendue dans les écrits des premiers philosophes libéraux, parmi lesquels les britanniques Mary Woolstonecraft ou John Stuart Mill, l'idée du droit de vote des femmes s'est progressivement répandue au fil du siècle pour donner lieu à une idéologie à part entière : le féminisme. L'expérience de la Première Guerre mondiale, lorsque les femmes travaillèrent en usine et exercèrent des métiers jusque là réservés aux hommes, serait l'un des pivots du droit des femmes à travailler, à voter et, dans d'autres domaines de la société, à atteindre un statut d'égalité avec les hommes.;Die Idee des Frauenwahlrechts fasste im Verlauft des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts in der westlichen Gesellschaft immer mehr Fuß. Zuerst von frühen liberalen Philosophen wie Englands Mary Woolstonecraft oder John Stuart Mill unterstützt, entwickelte sich die Idee und Ideologie des Frauenwahlrechts im weiteren Verlauf des Jahrhundert allmählich zu einer eigenen, kohärenten Ideologie, dem Feminismus.

end_moldavia_independence_desc;Ever since the 1829 Treaty of Adrianople, Wallachia and Moldavia were placed under Russian military rule, without overturning Ottoman suzerainty.

On the other hand, if he chose to dispose of a parcel of land, the serfs associated with that land stayed with it to serve their new lord, benefiting him with their long-acquired knowledge of practices suited to the land. Further, a serf could not abandon his lands without permission, nor did he possess a saleable title in them.

Its main impact occurred in the Balkans, where non-Slavic empires—the Byzantine Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Venice—had ruled the South Slavs for centuries. \n\nExtensive pan-Slavism began much like Pan-Germanism, both of which grew from the sense of unity and nationalism experienced within ethnic groups after the French Revolution and the consequent Napoleonic Wars against European monarchies. Like other Romantic nationalist movements, Slavic intellectuals and scholars in the developing fields of history, philology, and folklore actively encouraged the passion of their shared identity and ancestry. Pan-Slavism also co-existed with the Southern Slavic independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Among the four, the Beiyang Fleet was particularly sponsored by Li Hongzhang, one of the most trusted vassals of Empress Dowager Cixi and the principal patron of the ‘self-strengthening movement’ in northern China. \n\nUnlike the other Chinese fleets, the Beiyang Fleet consisted mostly of battleships imported from Germany and Britain. When the flagships Dingyuan and Zhenyuan were purchased from Germany, the superiority in strength of the Beiyang Fleet became evident, as Germany was the emerging world power, rivalling Britain (which dominated the ocean) in new naval construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

An earlier attempt to introduce railways had been made with the short-lived Shanghai to Wusong narrow gauge line known as the ‘Woosung Road Company’. \n\nThe late arrival of railways in China was due both to the lack of industrialization and sceptical attitude of the Qing government. Although diverse and prominent personages such as Lin Zexu and Taiping rebel Wang Hongren called for the building of railways in China in the mid-19th century, the conservatives in the Qing court considered steam engines to be ‘clever but useless’ contraptions, and resisted the railways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The government invited farmers, soldiers and other immigrants from across the nation to promote the development of the wild land. The Kaitakushi also invited Horace Capron, former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, to adopt overseas technology. The introduction of American technology helped advance both development and modernization, leading to the development of capital-intensive farming, the opening of coal mines and the construction of lumber mills, breweries and canneries that made use of local resources. With the construction and improvement of roads, ports and railways and the opening of the Seikan sea route between Honshu island (Aomori) and Hokkaido (Hakodate), urban areas will be formed throughout Hokkaido.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

During the next two years, President Bonaparte played his cards carefully, trying to win the hearts of the Roman Catholics and the population. During his mandate, his efforts to please the assembly probably derived from his hope that the assembly would reciprocate: he wanted funds from the treasury to pay his personal debts and run his household, along with a constitutional amendment that would allow him to run for a second term. By 1851 it was clear that the majority of the assembly was not ready to give the president what he wanted. Louis-Napoléon didn’t want to step down and proceeded with a plebiscite to emend the constitution.

The policies were centred around rapid industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture. Stalin desired to remove and replace any policies created under the New Economic Policy. The plan, overall, was to transition the Soviet Union from a weak, poorly controlled, agriculture state, into an industrial powerhouse.

forced_mycenaean_excavations_desc;Mycenaean Greece was the last phase of the Bronze Age in Ancient Greece, spanning the period from approximately 1600–1100 BC. It represents the first advanced civilization in mainland Greece, with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art and writing system. \n\nThe Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, the Linear B, offers the first written records of the Greek language and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon.\n\nMycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax. Mycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

galleria_ve_desc;The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is the oldest shopping mall in Italy, named after the first King of the united nation. The structure is formed by two glass-vaulted arcades intersecting in an octagon covering the street connecting Piazza del Duomo to Piazza della Scala. The street is covered by an arching glass and cast iron roof, a popular design for 19th-century arcades, such as the Burlington Arcade in London, which was the prototype for larger glazed shopping arcades, beginning with the Saint-Hubert Gallery in Brussels (opened in 1847), the Passazh in St Petersburg (opened in 1848), or the Budapest Galleria. The Milanese Galleria was larger in scale than its predecessors and was an important step in the evolution of the modern glazed and enclosed shopping mall, of which it was the direct progenitor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

golden_law_desc;The Lei Áurea (Golden Law) was sanctioned by Isabel, Imperial Princess of Brazil, who was regent at the time while her father, Emperor Dom Pedro II, was in Europe. It was signed on May 13, 1888 and was the law that abolished slavery in Brazil. It had only two articles. The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves – Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. The Brazilian government was also under pressure from Britain, who sought to end the slave trade in order to expand production in its own colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

imperial_japanese_navy_desc;Japanese statesman Iwakura Tomomi submitted a document to the Dajokan titled ‘Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion’ asserting that a strong navy was essential to maintaining the security of Japan. In furthering his argument, Iwakura suggested that domestic rebellions was no longer Japan’s primary military concern and that that naval affairs should take precedence over army concerns;a strong navy was more important than a sizable army to preserve the Japanese state. Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status. Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy.

integrate_uriankhai_desc;Lately, the Tannu Tuva economy has seriously deteriorated, resulting in the increasing poverty of its people. The causes were varied: declining number of fur-bearing animals probably due to over-hunting by both Uriankhais and Russians, declining number of livestock as a result of the export market to Siberia, and periodic natural disasters (especially droughts and plagues), which took a fearful toll on livestock herds. The end of Qing rule in Tannu Tuva brought chaos, bands of Uriankhai began plundering and burning Chinese shops. Uriankhai nobles were divided on their course of political action. The Uriankhai governor (amban-noyon), Gombo-Dorzhu, advocated becoming a protectorate of Russia, hoping that the Russians in turn would appoint him governor of Uriankhai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Although it was not the only such ‘mission’, it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West. It was first proposed by the influential Dutch missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck and was probably based on the model of the Grand Embassy of Peter I. The purposes of the mission were twofold: To renegotiate the unequal treaties with the Great Powers that Japan had been forced into during the previous decades and to gather information on education, technology, culture, and military, social and economic structures from the countries visited in order to affect the modernization of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The council included a few handpicked prominent Jamaicans for the sake of appearance only. In the late nineteenth century, Crown colony rule was modified; representation and limited self-rule were reintroduced gradually into Jamaica. The colony’s legal structure was reformed along the lines of English common law and county courts, and a constabulary force was established.\n\nThe smooth working of the Crown colony system was dependent on a good understanding and an identity of interests between the governing officials, who were British, and most of the nonofficial, nominated members of the Legislative Council, who were Jamaicans. The elected members of this body were in a permanent minority and without any influence or administrative power. The unstated alliance – based on shared colour, attitudes, and interest – between the British officials and the Jamaican upper class was reinforced in London, where the West India Committee lobbied for Jamaican interests. Jamaica’s white or near-white propertied class continued to hold the dominant position in every respect; the vast majority of the black population remained poor and unenfranchised.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jules_ferry_laws_desc;French education during the 19th century was marked by two distinct and segregated systems, the first being a secondary school system and the second a primary school system. However, in each of these systems, the Catholic Church provided an alternative to secular schooling that was often the only option for families in economically depressed regions of France. \n\nThe Jules Ferry Laws were a set of French Laws which established free education, then mandatory and laic (secular) education. Jules Ferry, a lawyer holding the office of Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, was widely credited for creating the modern Republican school (l’école républicaine). The dual system of state and church schools that were largely staffed by religious officials was replaced by state schools and lay school teachers. The educational reforms enacted by Jules Ferry are often attributed to a broader anti-clerical campaign in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

law_of_equality_desc;The Coremans–De Vriendt Law, also dubbed the Law of Equality (Dutch: Gelijkheidswet), was a Belgian law passed on 1898 which enforced formal legal equality of Dutch and French language in the country. It is seen as a landmark in the history of the Flemish Movement and of linguistic equality in Belgium.\n\nThe law was named after two Flemish deputies, Juliaan De Vriendt and Edward Coremans, who proposed the law. The law decreed equal validity for legal texts written in both French and Dutch, as well as decreeing bilingual signage in Flanders. As a result, parliamentary debates could be held in both languages and henceforth all laws were voted, passed and published in legally equivalent French and Dutch versions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

law_of_guarantees_desc;In 1870 ‘The Law of Guarantees’ was a law passed by the newly formed Kingdom of Italy—aimed at solving the ‘Roman Question’—that accorded the pope privileges similar to that of the King himself, including the right to send and receive ambassadors. Pope Pius IX refused to accept the laws, which were seen by both him and his successors as an infringement of the independence of the Holy See. While the issue was not conclusively solved until the Lateran Treaty of 1929, the Law of Guarantees nevertheless meant that the young Kingdom’s capital would from then on be Rome.;En 1870, la «Loi des garanties» fut passée par le tout jeune royaume d’Italie pour résoudre la «question romaine». Cette loi accordait au pape des privilèges équivalents à ceux du roi, y compris le droit de recevoir et de nommer des ambassadeurs. Le pape Pie IX refusa la loi, que lui-même et ses successeurs considéraient comme une atteinte à l'indépendance du Saint Siège. Si la question ne fut définitivement réglée qu’en 1929 avec le Traité de Latran, la loi des garanties a néanmoins établi que la capitale du nouveau royaume serait Rome.;Mit dem im Jahr 1870 vom neu gegründeten Königreich Italien verabschiedeten 'Garantiegesetz' sollte die 'Römische Frage' gelöst werden. Das Gesetz gestand dem Papst dieselben Privilegien wie dem König selbst zu, einschließlich dem Recht, Botschafter zu entsenden und zu empfangen. Papst Pius IX. lehnte das Gesetz ab, das er und seine Nachfolger als Schmälerung der Unabhängigkeit des Heiligen Stuhls betrachteten. Obwohl das Problem erst in den Lateranverträgen von 1929 endgültig gelöst werden konnte, bedeutete das Garantiegesetz trotzdem, dass die Hauptstadt des jungen Königreichs von jenem Zeitpunkt an Rom war.;;;;;;;;;;;x

luderitz_expedition_desc;First discovered in 1487 by the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias, the small coastal area known as Angra Pequena was made into a trading station by German trader Adolf Lüderitz in 1883. He concluded treaties with the neighbouring chiefs, buying large tracts of land for a total sum of 560 pounds sterling and 260 rifles. The new land was then named ‘Lüderitzland’. Lüderitz has plans to send expeditions further north, in the place the natives call Otjozondjii, known in German as Swakopmund but under the belief that a Great Power was about to claim the area as a protectorate, Lüderitz stalled his plans and asked for the protection of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government in $YEAR$.

megali_idea_desc;The ‘Megali Idea’, the Great Idea, was an irredentist conception of a Greater Greek state encompassing all ethnic Greeks, including in particular the substantial Greek minorities living on the Western Coast of Asia Minor. The concept was a driving force between much of Greece’s interactions with the fading Ottoman state during the 19th century, and the goals of the Great Idea came very close to a realization in the Treaty of Sèvres, signed at the end of World War One. The vast land gains that the Treaty of Sèvres accorded to Greece were however largely undone by the following Greco-Turkish war of 1919-21. Big is beautiful!;L’idée «Megali», la grande idée, est une conception irrédentiste d’une Grande Nation grecque qui rassemblerait tous les peuples d’ethnie grecque, en particulier la substantielle minorité vivant sur la côte occidentale de l’Asie mineure. Cette idée motiva la plupart des interactions de la Grèce ave l'Empire ottoman agonisant au cours du XIXe siècle et l'objectif de création d'une Grande Grèce fut bien près d'être atteint lors de la signature du Traité de Sèvre, à la fin de la Première guerre mondiale. Les vastes portions de territoire que le Traité de Sèvre accorda à la Grèce, furent largement perdues dans la guerre gréco-turque qui suivit entre 1919-1921. Big is beautiful!;"Die 'Megail-Idee"", die Große Idee, war eine irredentistische Vorstellung von einem Großgriechischen Staat, der alle Griechischstämmigen umfassen sollte, besonders die großen griechischen Minderheiten, die an der Westküste Kleinasiens lebten. Dieses Konzept war eine treibende Kraft hinter den griechischen Interaktionen mit dem im Niedergang befindlichen osmanischen Staat während des 19. Jahrhunderts, und im Vertrag von Sèvres, der am Ende des ersten Weltkriegs unterzeichnet wurde, kam man den Zielen der Großen Idee schon sehr nahe. Die weitläufigen Gebiete, die durch den Vertrag von Sèvres erlangt wurden, gingen im griechisch-türkischen Krieg von 1919-21 aber größtenteils wieder verloren.";;;;;;;;;;;x

melayu_raya_desc;Melayu Raya’ is the name of the all-archipelago nationalist movement in South East Asia that supported the idea of one single country uniting the Malay people rather than split into several colonies. As such, it ambitioned the union of the East Indies, Dutch, British and Portuguese into a country strong enough to fight off western imperialism. The Pan-Malay union was based on understandings on similarities in race, shared language, religion and culture among ethnic groups.

Their syllabic script, the Linear B, offers the first written records of the Greek language and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon.\n\nMycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax. Mycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

occupy_countryside_desc;The early days of Liberia were marked by constant frontier troubles with other Colonizing Powers on the Ivory Coast and at Sierra Leone. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ tried to extend their authority inland, although they were still unable to control all of the coastal area they claimed. In the wake of the Scramble for Africa, several deals were made with the indigenous people in inland Liberia that allowed us to claim and occupy the land under the principle of effective occupation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

On his death in 1865, his successor, William Henry Clarence, wasn’t recognized by our government and with their allies and protectors far away, organizing a quick invasion and occupation of the territory who rightfully belongs to our country should be an easy affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Slowly annexed by the United Kingdom over the course of the 18th century, Acadia is once again in French hands. If we intend to keep Acadia this time, we must invest in the colony, funding new settlers, deportation of rebellious English colonials, and building infrastructure throughout the colony. If we are successful, we will have a far greater control over Canada and the North American coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

organize_algeria_departments_desc;Shortly after Louis Philippe’s constitutional monarchy was overthrown, the new government of the Second Republic ended Algeria’s status as a colony and declared in the $YEAR$ Constitution the occupied lands an integral part of France. Three civil territories Alger, Oran, and Constantine were organized as Departments of France under a civilian government. This made them a part of France proper as opposed to a colony. \n\n For the first time, French citizens in the civil territories elected their own councils and mayors. Muslims had to be appointed, could not hold more than one-third of council seats, and could not serve as mayors or assistant mayors. \n\nThe administration of territories outside the zones settled by colons remained under the French Army. Local Muslim administration was allowed to continue under the supervision of French Army commanders, charged with maintaining order in newly pacified regions, and the bureaux arabes. Theoretically, these areas were closed to European colonization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the Mahmudiye Marsi.\n\nLike in many other monarchies of its time, the anthem of the Ottoman Empire was an imperial anthem, not a national one. Hence it paid homage to a specific ruler and a new anthem was composed at each imperial succession. However, in $YEAR$, with the Tanzimat reforms, the Mecidiye Marsi was recognized as the first official Ottoman national anthem.

peking_convention_desc;Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Argun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China. In the mid-19th century the Russians would expand beyond this border to seize the vast lands between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River. The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor’s summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov’s gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia. Thus, Russia had gained some 350,000 square miles of territory without firing a single shot.;Depuis le traité de Nerchinsk (1689), l’Empire russe a reconnu le fleuve Argun et les monts Stanovoy comme frontière naturelle entre la Russie et la Chine. Au cours du XIXe siècle, les Russes franchirent cette frontière pour s’emparer des vastes territoires entre les monts Stanovoy et le fleuve Amour. Les Puissances occidentales mirent plus tard un terme à la seconde guerre de l’opium en brûlant les palais d’été de l’empereur et en s’emparant de Pékin. Un général russe avisé du nom de Nicolaï Ignatiev parvint à convaincre les chinois que seul le soutien de la Russie permettrait l'évacuation de Pékin par les alliés. Le prix de ce soutien fut la convention de Pékin, qui entérinait les conquêtes de Muravyov et cédait à la Russie les territoires entre le fleuve Ussuri et la côte pacifique. Ainsi, la Russie gagna-t-elle 560000 kilomètres carrés sans tirer un coup de fusil.;Seit dem Vertrag von Nertschinsk (1689) hatte das russische Reich den Fluss Argun und das Stanowoigebirge als natürliche Grenze zwischen Russland und China betrachtet. Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts wollten die Russen diese Grenze erweitern, um das weiträumige Gebiet zwischen dem Stanowoigebirge und dem Fluss Amur zu annektieren. Später beendeten die westlichen Alliierten den zweiten Opiumkrieg durch Niederbrennen der Sommerpaläste des chinesischen Kaisers und marschierten in Peking ein. Der gerissene Generalmajor Nikolai Ignatjew konnte die Chinesen überzeugen, dass sie die Westmächte nur mit russischer Unterstützung zum Abzug bewegen können würden. Der Preis für diese Unterstützung war die Pekinger Konvention, die Murawjows Forderungen bestätigte und Russland zusätzlich noch das Territorium zwischen dem Fluss Ussuri und dem Pazifik zusprach. Russland hatte sich also einen Gebietsgewinn von 350000 Quadratmeilen verschafft, ohne einen einzigen Schuss dafür abzufeuern.;;;;;;;;;;;x

This could be achieved most effectively with an exchange, and ‘the best guarantees for the security and development of the minorities remaining’ after the exchange ‘would be those supplied both by the laws of the country and by the liberal policy of Turkey with regard to all communities whose members have not deviated from their duty as Turkish citizens’. An exchange would also be useful as a response to violence in the Balkans: ‘there were’, in any event, ‘over a million Turks without food or shelter in countries in which neither Europe nor America took nor was willing to take any interest’.

privatise_farms_desc;State farms, began to be created in the early 1920s as an ideological example of ‘socialist agriculture of the highest order’. Kolkhozes or collective farms were regarded for a long time as an intermediate stage in the transition to the ideal of state farming. While kolkhozy were typically created by combining small individual farms together in a cooperative structure, a sovkhoz would be organised by the state on land confiscated from former large estates and sovkhoz workers would be recruited from among landless rural residents. The sovkhoz employees would be paid regulated wages, whereas the remuneration system in a kolkhoz relied on cooperative-style distribution of farm earnings (in cash and in kind) among the members. In farms of both types, however, a system of internal passports prevented movement of employees and members from rural areas to urban areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

promulgate_the_ems_ukaz_desc;The Ems Ukaz was a decree published by Tsar Alexander II in 1876, banning the use of the Ukrainian language, disparagingly referred to as ‘the Little Russian dialect’, in any and all printed material, with exception only made for the reprinting of old documents.

L'ukaz porte le nom de Bad Ems, station thermale allemande où le tsar résidait lorsqu'il fut promulgué.";Die Ems Ukaz war ein von Zar Alexander II. im Jahr 1876 veröffentlichtes Dekret, das in jeglichen Druckerzeugnissen außer in Neudrucken alter Dokumente die Benutzung der ukrainischen Sprache verbot, die man abfällig als 'den kleinen russischen Dialekt' nannte. Die Ukaz war nach Bad Ems in Deutschland benannt, einem deutschen Kurort, in dem sich der Zar bei der Verkündigung der Ukaz aufhielt.;;;;;;;;;;;x

prussian_settlement_commission_desc;The Prussian Settlement Commission was a Prussian government commission that operated from 1886. It was set up by Otto von Bismarck to increase land ownership by Germans at the expense of Poles, by economic and political means, in the German Empire’s eastern provinces of West Prussia and the Posen as part of his larger efforts aiming at the eradication of the Polish nation. \n\nThe Commission was one of Prussia’s prime instruments in the official policy of Germanization of the historically Polish lands of West Prussia (the former Royal Prussia) and the dissolved Grand Duchy of Posen. The Commission ultimately purchased 613 estates from German owners and 214 from Poles, functioning to bail out German debtors often rather than fulfilling its declared national mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

reforms_of_abdul_hamid_ii_desc;Abdul Hamid II was the 34th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He oversaw a period of decline, with rebellions, particularly in the Balkans, he suspended both the Ottoman constitution and Parliament in $YEAR$ and accomplished highly effective power and control. \n\nModernisation of the Ottoman Empire occurred during his reign, including reform of the bureaucracy, the extension of the Rumelia Railway and Anatolia Railway and the construction of the Baghdad Railway and Hejaz Railway. In addition, a system for population registration and control over the press was established along with the first local modern law school in 1898. The most far-reaching of these reforms were in education: many professional schools were established, including Law School, School of Arts, School of Trades, Civil Engineering School, The Veterinarian School, The Customs School, The Farming School, The Linguistic School, and more.\n\nAbdul Hamid II attached utmost importance to the reorganization of the military. As early as 1880 he sought, and two years later secured, German assistance, which culminated in the appointment of Lt. Col. Kohler and, finally, Colmar Von der Goltz as military advisors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

reforms_of_abdulmejid_i_desc;Sultan Abdulmejid I enjoyed several years of peace, which enabled him to form a powerful and well-disciplined army that was established at the beginning of the year $YEAR$.\n\nThe chain-of-command in the general staff of each army was composed of a commander-in-chief, two lieutenant-generals, three brigadiers of infantry, one of whom commands the reserve, two brigadiers of cavalry, and one brigadier of artillery. In each corps there were three regiments of infantry, two of cavalry, and one of artillery, with thirty-three guns. The total strength of these twelve regiments of active forces was 30,000 men, but it was diminished in time of peace by furlough to an effective strength of about 25,000 men in three of the six armies, as well as 15,000 troops in the other three, a consequence of the recruiting system being as yet incomplete in its application all over the Ottoman Empire. The whole establishment of this branch amounts, therefore, to 180,000 men, belonging to the active service, but its effective strength is at present 123,000.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

repeal_the_corn_laws_desc;The ‘Corn Laws’ were a series of vastly unpopular tariffs, often described as a rare example of British mercantilism, designed to ‘protect’ British farmers and corn prices from cheap foreign competition, which, naturally, had the effect of effectively increasing corn prices for Britain’s poor. After the failed harvest of 1845, and the following Potato Famine in Ireland, the Corn Laws were finally repealed in 1846. The failure of these tariffs heralded a long period of British commitment to the ideals of Laissez-faire capitalism, that was to last for most of the 19th century.;"Les ""lois sur le grain"" regroupaient une série de droits de douanes très impopulaires, souvent décrites comme un rare exemple de mercantilisme britannique, conçues pour ""protéger"" les fermiers anglais et les prix du blé de la concurrence étrangère, ce qui, naturellement, avait pour effet d'augmenter les prix du blé pour les plus pauvres. Après la mauvaise récolte de 1845 et la Grande Famine irlandaise, les lois sur le grain finirent par être abrogées en 1846. L'échec de ces droits de douane marqua le début d'une longue période d'engagement britannique à l'égard des idéaux du capitalisme laxiste qui allait perdurer pendant presque tout le XIXe siècle.";Die 'Korngesetze' waren eine Reihe äußerst unbeliebter Zollabgaben, die oft als seltenes Beispiel für britischen Merkantilismus beschrieben wurden. Mit diesen Einfuhrzöllen sollte die britische Landwirtschaft vor der billigen ausländischen Konkurrenz 'geschützt' werden, aber natürlich erhöhte dies den Armen Englands nur die Kornpreise. Nach der Missernte von 1845 und der darauf folgenden Kartoffel-Hungersnot in Irland wurden die Korngesetze 1846 endlich aufgehoben. Das Scheitern dieser Zölle leite eine lange Periode britischer Verbundenheit mit den Idealen des Laissez Faire-Kapitalismus ein, die den Großteil des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts überspannte.;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Treaty of Paucarpata agreed to the devolution of all captured ships by Chile, the restoration of commercial relations between the Confederation and Chile, the withdrawal of all Chilean troops from Confederate territories and the payment by the Confederacy of the former Peruvian foreign debts with Chile. The Chilean troops were reembarked. When Admiral Blanco Encalada returned rather ignominiously to Valparaíso with the fleet and the army in December, 1837, the scandal was gigantic. The Chilean government and the Chilean public opinion repudiated the treaty in indignation. Admiral Blanco Encalada as was thrown into jail and tried for high treason, together with his advisor Antonio José de Irisarri, who had refused to even return to Chile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ric_reorganize_desc;The first organised police forces in Ireland came about through the Peace Preservation Act in 1814 for which Sir Robert Peel (1788-1850) was largely responsible and the Irish Constabulary Act in 1822 formed the provincial constabularies. The 1822 Act established a force in each province with chief constables and inspectors general under the civil administration for Ireland controlled by the Dublin Castle administration. \n\nThe original force had been reorganised under The Act of 1836, and the first constabulary code of regulations was published in 1837. The discipline was strict and the pay low. The police faced civil unrest among the Irish rural poor, and was involved in bloody confrontations during the period of the Tithe War. Other deployments were against organisations like the Ribbonmen, which attacked landlords, their property and stock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

riot_control_desc;Riot control refers to the measures used by police, military, or other security forces to control, disperse, and arrest people who are involved in a riot, demonstration, or protest. However, these methods usually fail when there is severe anger with a legitimate cause, or the riot was planned or organized. Law enforcement officers or military personnel have long used less lethal weapons such as batons and whips to disperse crowds and detain rioters. Since the 1980s, riot control officers have also used tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and electric tasers. In some cases, riot squads may also use Long Range Acoustic Devices, water cannons, armoured fighting vehicles, aerial surveillance, police dogs or mounted police on horses. Officers performing riot control typically wear protective equipment such as riot helmets, face visors, body armour (vests, neck protectors, knee pads, etc.), gas masks and riot shields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Goldie’s cash-flush NAC was then able to maintain 30 trading posts along the river and buy out opposing interests in the region and eventually, he was able to crow that it ‘remained alone in undisputed commercial possession of the Niger–Binué region’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The system of military education was also reformed, and elementary education was made available to all the draftees. \n\nMilyutin’s reforms are regarded as a milestone in the history of Russia: they dispensed with the military recruitment and professional army introduced by Peter the Great and created the Russian army such as it continued into the 21st century.

shinbutsu_bunri_desc;The Japanese term shinbutsu bunri indicates the separation of Shinto from Buddhism, introduced after the Meiji Restoration, and therefore the separation of kami (native Shinto deities) from Buddhas (Buddhist deities), and of Buddhist temples from Shinto shrines (jinja). Until the end of the Edo period Shinto and Buddhism were intimately connected in what was called shinbutsu-shugo, to the point that the same buildings were often used as both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, and Shinto gods were interpreted as manifestations of Buddhas. The new government saw shinbutsu bunri as a way to reduce the immense wealth and power of the Buddhist sects. At the same time, it was supposed to give Shinto, and especially its cult of the Emperor, time to grow into an effective vehicle for nationalism. A first order issued by the Jingijimuka on $YEAR$ ordered the defrocking of shaso and betto (shrine monks performing Buddhist rites at Shinto shrines). A few days later, the Daijokan banned the application of Buddhist terminology such as gongen to Japanese kami and the veneration of Buddhist statues in shrines. Next came a ban on applying the Buddhist term Daibosatsu (Great Bodhisattva) to the syncretic kami Hachiman at the Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu and Usa Hachiman-gu shrines.

sign_the_berne_treaty_desc;As early as 1863, the United States had organized a conference on the idea of an international treaty on posts. One of the biggest proponents came to be Heinrich von Stephan, Prussian and later German Minister for Posts (pictured above) under Bismarck. In 1874, the Government of Switzerland hosted an international conference at Berne where an agreement was signed in October to establish the General Postal Union. The treaty came into effect in July of 1875, and the number of signatories steadily increased after it was renamed the Universal Postal union in 1878. The UPU was designed to standardize mailing rates, facilitate transit of foreign mail, and establish the authority of each nation over all postal revenues generated within its borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

singapore_strategy_desc;The Singapore strategy was a naval defence policy of the British Empire that evolved in a series of war plans from 1919 to 1941. It aimed to deter aggression by the Empire of Japan by providing for a base for a fleet of the Royal Navy in the Far East, able to intercept and defeat a Japanese force heading south towards India or Australia. To be effective it required a well-equipped base;Singapore, at the eastern end of the Strait of Malacca, was chosen in 1919 as the location of this base;work continued on this naval base and its defences over the next two decades. The planners envisaged that a war with Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms.;;;;;;;;;;;x

Indeed, the 19th century was a period of great change throughout Europe and many feared that the country’s many traditional customs and occupations might be lost to history. After extensive traveling, Hazelius bought around 150 houses from all over the country and built a full replica of an average 19th-century town, in which craftsmen in traditional dress such as tanners, shoemakers, silversmiths, bakers and glass-blowers demonstrate their skills in period surroundings—along with a full range of various Scandinavian animals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

support_french_foreign_legion_desc;‘La Légion Étrangère’, known in English as ‘The Foreign Legion’, is military unit of the French army, with a unique distinction in that it accepts its recruits regardless of their national and personal backgrounds. While originally established as early as 1830, the Legion did not win the lasting legacy it enjoys today until it had seen action during, among others, The Spanish Carlist Wars, The French Intervention in Mexico, the Battle of Camarón, the Franco-Prussian war and, in fact, almost every conflict involving France up until and through the modern era. The image of the young man, perhaps on the run from some personal tragedy, oppression, debt or a criminal past, who joins the French Foreign Legion to serve a tour of personal redemption in the deserts of French Algeria, has since become one of the most iconic and enduring images of the 19th century. Promote the Legion, and see recruits flock to our banners.;La Légion étrangère est une unité militaire de l'armée française qui se distingue par le recrutement de ses membres quelles que soient leur nationalité ou leur histoire personnelle. Initialement formée dans les années 1830, la Légion étrangère gagna véritablement ses galons lors des guerres espagnoles carlistes, de l'intervention française au Mexique, de la bataille de Camarón, de la guerre franco-prusse ainsi que pratiquement tous les conflits impliquant la France et ce, jusqu'à nos jours. L'image du jeune homme, peut-être en proie à une tragédie personnelle, à une oppression, à une dette ou à un passé criminel, qui rejoint la Légion étrangère en guise de rédemption dans les déserts de l'Algérie française, est l'une des images les plus symboliques du XIXe siècle.

Sie ist einzigartig dahingehend, dass sie Rekruten aus allen Nationen und persönlichen Hintergründen akzeptiert. Die Fremdenlegion wurde ursprünglich im Jahr 1830 gegründet, aber ihren heutigen Ruf erkämpfte sie sich erst durch Einsätze in den spanischen Karlistenkriegen, bei der französischen Intervention in Mexiko, der Schlacht von Camarón, dem deutsch-französischen Krieg und eigentlich fast jedem anderen Konflikt Frankreichs. Die Vorstellung von einem jungen Mann, der vielleicht vor einer persönlichen Tragödie, Unterdrückung, Schulden oder einer kriminellen Vergangenheit flieht und der französischen Fremdenlegion beitritt, um durch seinen Dienst in den Wüsten des französischen Algeriens seine persönliche Erlösung zu finden, ist seither zu einer der ikonischsten und dauerhaftesten des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts geworden.

tanzimat_reforms_desc;Tanzimat’ Turkish for ‘reorganization’ was a series of reforms enacted by the Ottoman state during the latter half of the 19th century, designed to counteract the rising tides of nationalism among the Empire’s vast and varied ethnic minorities. The reforms aimed at integrating the various populations under the common banner of ‘Ottomanism’, by promoting the Ottoman state as an alternative to the ethnicity-based nation states that many of the radicalized minorities within the state were, at the time, seeking to establish, and by granting increased representation and autonomy within the state. While the Tanzimat was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the decline of the Ottoman state, it can nevertheless be argued that the reforms at least postponed it.;"Les réformes de ""Tanzimat"", le mot turc qui signifie ""réorganisation"", furent adoptées par l'État ottoman, au cours de la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle, en réaction contre la montée du nationalisme au sein des diverses minorités ethniques de l'empire. Ces réformes visaient à intégrer la population sous la bannière commune d'Ottomanisme en promouvant l'État ottoman comme alternative à l'ethnicité basée sur les États de la nation que bon nombre de minorités radicales, au sein même de l'empire, cherchaient à établir, et en y accordant une représentation et une autonomie plus large. Alors que les réformes de ""Tanzimat"" ne parvinrent pas à prévenir le déclin de l'État ottoman, force est de constater qu'elles le retardèrent.";Tanzimat' ist Türkisch für 'Neuorganisation'. So wurde eine Reihe von Reformen bezeichnet, die der osmanische Staat während des zweiten Hälfte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts auf den Weg brachte, um den steigenden Nationalismusgefühlen der zahlreichen und unterschiedlichen ethnischen Minderheiten des Reichs entgegen zu wirken. Die Reformen zielten auf die Integration der verschiedenen Bevölkerungen unter dem gemeinsamen Banner des 'Osmanismus' ab, indem der osmanische Staat als Alternative für die auf Volkszugehörigkeit basierenden Nationalstaaten präsentiert wurde, die viele der radikalisierten Minderheiten damals bilden wollten. Die Hauptargumente waren dabei eine stärkere Repräsentation und Autonomie innerhalb des osmanischen Staats. Während die Tanzimat den Niedergang des osmanischen Reichs nicht verhindern konnte, so zögerten ihn die Reformen zumindest etwas hinaus.;;;;;;;;;;;x

thai_constitution_desc;The Rattanakosin Kingdom and the four traditionally counted preceding kingdoms, collectively called Siam, had an uncodified constitution until $YEAR$. In the preamble to the Penal Code King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) stated: ‘In the ancient times the monarchs of the Siamese nation governed their people with laws which were originally derived from the Dhamasustra of Manu, which was then the prevailing law among the inhabitants of India and the neighbouring countries.\n\nThe constitution continued to state that sovereign power belonged to the people of Siam. However, unlike the temporary charter, the monarchy would now be the direct exerciser of that power, rather than the branches of government. This royal power would be exercised by and with the advice and consent of the People’s Assembly, the State Council (the cabinet), and the courts. However, the monarchy lacked any say in the composition of any of the branches of government and the royal veto could still be overruled. The monarchy was also made ‘sacred and inviolable’, in contrast to the temporary charter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_1854_plan_desc;Born into a lower-middle-class family in Lille, Louis Faidherbe is a sub-director of engineers in the colonies of Senegal. He plays a central role in the implementation of ‘The Plan of $YEAR$’: a series of ministerial orders given to Governor Protet of Senegal that originated in petitions from the powerful Boudreaux-based Maurel and Prom company, the largest shipping interest in Saint-Louis. The plan specified in detail the creation of forts along the Sénégal River to end African control of the acacia gum trade from the interior. Faidherbe’s push to build fortifications farther out generated conflicts with Protet, and his protests to Paris over Protet’s inaction quickly awarded him some sympathy in the government. If we were to appoint him to chef de bataillon and then governor of the colony, we could quickly put the plan in action and take control of the coastal Wolof kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Following the opening of the Suez Canal, the trade routes shifted and we are now in a position to strike a deal with the civilized protectors of the Aceh: allow us a free hand within their sphere of influence in Maritime Southeast Asia while we also take the responsibility to fight piracy in the region.

the_case_of_edgardo_mortara_desc;Edgardo Mortara was born to Jewish parents in Bologna in 1851. During a period of illness in 1857, a Catholic servant girl of the Mortara family baptized Edgardo, for fear that he might otherwise, as a non-Christian, go to Hell if he died. On the basis of this baptism, the Papal States’ police took Edgardo away from his family, and had him raised as a Roman Catholic, as non-Christians were, according to Papal States’ law, forbidden to raise Christian children, even their own. The case, or kidnapping, caused an international uproar, and was protested by, among others, Napoleon III, Emperor Franz Josef and The London Times. Mortara himself would go on to become a Catholic priest, and resumed contact with his siblings and mother in his later life.;Edgardo Mortara est né de parents juifs à Bologne en 1851. En 1857, alors qu'il était malade, une servante catholique de la famille Mortara fit baptiser Edgardo de peur qu'il meure et aille en enfer parce qu'il n'était pas chrétien. Sous prétexte qu'il était baptisé, la police pontificale enleva Edgardo à sa famille et le fit élever comme un catholique, car l'Église interdisait aux non chrétiens d'élever des enfants chrétiens, même les leurs. L'affaire, ou l'enlèvement, devint un scandale international et fit l'objet de protestations de Napoléon III, de l'empereur François-Joseph et du London Times. Mortara fut plus tard ordonné prêtre catholique et ne reprit contact avec ses frères et sœurs qu'à la fin de sa vie.;Edgardo Mortara wurde als Sohn jüdischer Eltern 1851 in Bologna geboren. Als er 1857 erkrankte, wurde er von einem katholischen Dienstmädchen der Mortata-Familie auf den Namen Edgardo getauft, da er als Nichtchrist fürchtete, im Falle seines Todes in die Hölle zu müssen. Aufgrund dieser Taufe wurde Edgardo von der Polizei des Kirchenstaats aus seiner Familie entfernt. Daraufhin wurde er römisch-katholisch erzogen, da es Nichtchristen gemäß den Gesetzen des Kirchenstaats verboten war, eigene Kinder aufzuziehen. Dieser Fall bzw. die Entführung führte zu internationalen Protesten, unter anderem von Napoleon III., Kaiser Franz Josef und der London Times. Mortara selbst wurde katholischer Priester und nahm später in seinem Leben wieder Kontakt mit seinen Geschwistern und seiner Mutter auf.;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_ever_victorious_army_desc;The Ever-Victorious Army consisted of Chinese soldiers trained and led by an American and European officer corps. Though the Army was only active for a few years, from 1860 to 1864, it was instrumental in putting down the Taiping Rebellion. It was the first Chinese army which was trained in European techniques, tactics, and strategy. As such, it became a model for later Chinese armies. \n\n The Ever-Victorious Army numbered around 5,000 soldiers at its height. It often defeated rebel forces which were numerically much larger because it was better armed, better commanded, and better trained. It was the first Chinese army to incorporate western style training and tactics, modern weaponry, and most important, the concept of light fast moving infantry units which could move faster than their opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Moyennant le rétablissement du règne impérial, ainsi que la mise ne place d'un vaste programme de modernisation industriel, de constitutionalisme et de liberté économique, le Japon devrait pouvoir rompre les fers que lui a imposé le monde occidental.;Die Gründung Japans wird üblicherweise dem Kaiser Jimmu im Jahr 660 v.Chr. zugeschrieben und obwohl die kaiserliche Abstammungslinie seitdem ununterbrochen ist wurde das Kaiseramt während der Edo-Zeit kontinuierlich zu einer verehrten und respektierten aber letztendlich machtlosen politischen Institution reduziert. Durch die Restauration der kaiserlichen Herrschaft im Einklang einem Programm für rasche industrielle Modernisierung Konstitutionalismus und Gewerbefreiheit könnte Japan die Fesseln sprengen die ihm von der westlichen Welt angelegt wurden.;;;;;;;;;;;x

Before the reforms, governors inherited their posts from their family lineage, and lived on taxes they collected in their area, a practice formally called tax farming. These were converted from hereditary governors to appointed governmental posts, as had been done by Chinese Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era rulers in first recognizing Tusi (tribal leaders) as imperial officials, then replacing them with imperial appointees. The arrangement resulted in governors being appointed and paid by the central government, and mueang developed into provinces. \n\nResistance to these reforms would cause uprisings by traditional local leaders around the Kingdom for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Old Summer Palace was burnt to the ground by Anglo-French forces during their occupation of Beijing during the Second Opium War. While the torching was a major blow to Chinese morale, it was also decried by many European intellectuals, Victor Hugo among others, as a criminal act of brutality directed against the Chinese.

treaty_of_akhal_desc;Years of ineffective rulers have significantly weakened the rulers of Ashkhabad, yet they claim the territories of Turkestan and Transoxiana.

However our diplomatic efforts to solve this have been rejected. This time, we will force them to the negotiating table at gunpoint. We will send a column to the outskirts of Ashkhabad, we will send envoys to let them know we will burn everything from Ashkhabad to their capital unless they accept our demands: the surrender of Geok Tepe, Ashkhabad and renouncing any claims they might have on Turkestan. However, if they refuse our generous offer, this will mean war will break out immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Its practical effects were limited, since the Italo-German and Japanese operational theatres were on opposite sides of the world and the high contracting powers had disparate strategic interests.

turkish_tea_desc;Turkish tea, called çay, is an important part of Turkish culture. Offering tea to guests is part of Turkish hospitality though tea is most often consumed in households, shops and mostly kiraathane, which is social congregation of Turkish men. Turkish tea is typically prepared using two stacked kettles called ‘çaydanlik’ specially designed for tea preparation. Water is brought to a boil in the larger lower kettle and then some of the water is used to fill the smaller kettle on top and steep (infuse) several spoons of loose tea leaves, producing a very strong tea. Despite the growing popularity of tea in $COUNTRY$, there are no tea producing provinces in our homeland. Now the microclimate region along the eastern coast of the Black Sea was identified by specialists as an ideal spot to start tea production, which will contribute to the task of fulfilling the growing demand for tea by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens.

von_moltkes_staff_reforms_desc;In 1857 Helmuth von Moltke was appointed Chief of the Prussian General Staff, which he soon set about reforming. Among the ideas implemented by von Moltke were a department for historical studies, extensive wargaming exercises and a special department dedicated to cataloguing and studying the telegraph and railway networks of Prussia, and how they could be used to best effect in the event of war. The end result was that, by the time of the Franco-Prussian war, Prussia’s General Staff was considered the most efficient in Europe, it’s methods soon becoming widely studied and adopted abroad. Moltke remained Chief of the Prussian Staff for the next 30 years, and is known as one of the most brilliant military strategists of the 19th century.;En 1857, Helmut von Moltke fut nommé Chef de l’état-major de la Prusse, qu’il entreprit bientôt de réformer.

Le résultat fut que lors de la guerre de 1870, l’état-major prussien étai de loin le plus efficace d’Europe et ses méthodes commencèrent à être étudiées et copiées à l’étranger. Moltke resta Chef d’état-major de la Prusse pendant 30 ans et demeure l’un des plus brillants stratèges militaires du XIXe siècle.;Im Jahr 1857 wurde Helmuth von Moltke zum Chef des preußischen Generalstabs ernannt, den er schon kurz darauf reformierte.

Aufgrund dieser Anstrengungen galt der preußische Generalstab zur Zeit des französisch-preußischen Krieges als der effizienteste in ganz Europa, dessen Methoden man im Ausland schon bald eingehend studierte und nachahmte. Von Moltke übte sein Amt die nächsten 30 Jahre aus und gilt als einer der brillantesten Militärstrategen des 19. Jahrhunderts.;;;;;;;;;;;x

weihaiwei_treaty_port_eng_desc;The port of Weihaiwei serves as the base for the Beiyang Fleet (Northern Seas Fleet) for the Qing Dynasty. After the Russian Empire leased Port Arthur from China for 25 years in March 1898, the United Kingdom pressured the Chinese government into leasing Weihaiwei, with the terms of the treaty stating that it would remain in force for as long as the Russians were allowed to occupy Port Arthur. The port was primarily used as a summer anchorage for the Royal Navy’s China Station and it was also used as a health resort. It served as a port of call for ships of the Royal Navy in the Far East (well behind Hong Kong in the south). Certain aspects of the administration not directly pertaining to military matters were left under Chinese control, and the port itself remained a free port until 1923.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

westernize_nation_desc;Our country is under intellectual assault by modernity and the Western World. In the fields of modern technology, industry and military theory, the old traditions and institutions no longer serve us as they used to. Everywhere we turn, western influences spread like wildfire through our nation, our population, and our souls. If we are to remain what we always have been, and not become something else entirely, now is the time to assume control of our own destiny. It has become apparent to the leading members of our intellectual elite, that the only way to turn the tide on the Western Leviathan is to swim with it, for, as Sun Tzu says: The reed that bends before the wind, also offers a form of resistance.;"Notre pays est la cible d'une attaque intellectuelle lancée par la modernité et le monde occidental. Dans les domaines de la technologie, de l'industrie et la théorie militaire moderne, les vieilles traditions et institutions ne nous sont plus aussi utiles qu'avant. Partout autour de nous, les influences occidentales se propagent, tel un incendie incontrôlable, dans notre nation, notre population et nos esprits. Pour conserver notre identité et éviter tout changement radical, il nous faut prendre en main notre destin. Il apparaît évident pour les responsables de notre élite intellectuelle que la seule manière d'inverser la tendance face au mastodonte occidental consiste à lui emboîter le pas car, comme le dit, Sun Tzu : ""le roseau qui plie face au vent ne cède pas"".";Unser Land steht unter einem intellektuellen Angriff der Modernität und der westlichen Welt. In den Feldern Moderne Technologie, Industrie- und Militärtheorie leisten und die alten Traditionen und Institutionen nicht mehr so gute Dienste wie früher. Wo auch immer man hinsieht verbreiten sich westliche Einflüsse in unserer Nation, unter unserer Bevölkerung und in unseren Seelen wie ein Lauffeuer. Wenn wir so bleiben möchten wir bisher und unser Wesen nicht vollständig verändern wollen, ist jetzt die Zeit gekommen, um unser Schicksal in die eigenen Hände zu nehmen. Führende Mitglieder unserer intellektuellen Elite haben erkannt, dass der einzige Weg, das westliche Meerungeheuer aufzuhalten, eine Weile mit ihm zu schwimmen. Wie schon Sun sagte: Das Schilfrohr, dass sich im Wind biegt, liefert auch eine Art von Widerstand.;;;;;;;;;;;x
