1850_compromise_desc;Senators Henry Clay and Stephen A. Douglas have presented a draft proposal for a compromise on the slavery issue centred around the premise of popular sovereignty as the determinant for slavery or abolitionism in the territories. By supporting the draft proposal, we could calm tensions over the slavery issue for at least some time. The compromise is a package of five separate bills which will defuse a four-year political confrontation between slave and free states regarding the status of territories acquired during the Mexican-American War. The mains points are:\n1. Texas surrenders its claim to New Mexico, over which it had threatened war, as well as its claims north of the Missouri Compromise Line. It retains the Texas Panhandle and the federal government will took over the state’s public debt.\n2. California is admitted as a free state with its current boundaries.\n3.The Wilmot Proviso will be fully rejected.\n4.The slave trade (but not slavery altogether) will be banned in Washington D.C.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

abolish_los_fueros_desc;The relentless centralizing drive of the Spanish Crown led, after the end of the First Carlist War, to the reduction of the Basque institutional and legal system (called Fueros), but it was only after the last Carlist War that it was virtually wiped out. After the war, a new Spanish constitution was drawn up in order to establish a unitarian and central administration in Spain cut out according to a Spanish-Castilian pattern. Navarre was affected, but for the moment it was spared from further curtailments due to their 1841 ‘Compromise Act’ (Ley Paccionada) that turned officially the semi-autonomous Kingdom of Navarre into another province of Spain. The Basques were forced to enrol in the Spanish military on an individual basis, and not in separate groups or corps, despite the fact that many Basques could hardly articulate a pair of phrases in Spanish, exposing them at best to stressful experiences.

abolish_serfdom_desc;The institution of serfdom—unfree farm labour tied to the land of a local noble, effectively a form of feudal slavery—had existed in various forms in Russia since the Kievan Rus of the 11th century. Throughout the ages the institution had undergone several reforms and changes, but the first steps toward a complete abolishment were taken only in the 1810s, when the institution was abolished in the Russian domains of Kurland, Estonia and Livonia. The institution was only abolished in all of Russia with the agrarian reform of 1861, during the reign of Tsar Alexander II, who at the time feared that the Russian peasantry might otherwise seek their liberation through outright revolution. He believed the changes must come from above, lest they start coming from below. To balance the effect of freeing over 23 million serfs at once and having them buy land from the aristocracy, a transitional period of 2 years was declared, some lands were passed to major land owners, and government paid aristocracy in bonds, while serfs payment was taken care of, but now they owed the government for the purchase money plus interest. Redemption Payments were declared to last for 49 years.;Le système de servage, une main-d'œuvre privée de liberté rattachée aux terres d'un noble local, une forme d'esclavage féodal, a existé en Russie depuis la Rus' de Kiev du XIe siècle. Au fil du temps, ce système a fait l'objet de plusieurs réformes et évolutions, mais les premières mesures d'abolition ne furent prises que dans les années 1810, époque à laquelle il fut aboli dans les domaines russes du Kurland, d'Estonie et de Livonie. Il fallut attendre la réforme agraire de 1861 pour voir l'abolition totale de ce système, sous le règne du tsar Alexandre II qui craignait, à l'époque, un soulèvement de la paysannerie russe.;Die Einführung der Leibeigenschaft—unfreie Landarbeit auf den Ländereien eines lokalen Adligen, also eine Art feudaler Sklaverei—hatte in Russland seit der Kiewer Rus im elften Jahrhundert in verschiedenen Formen existiert. Im Laufe der wurde die Leibeigenschaft mehreren Reformen und Veränderungen unterworfen, aber erste Schritte in Richtung einer vollständigen Abschaffungen wurden erst in den 1810er Jahren unternommen, als die Leibeigenschaft in den russischen Domänen Kurland, Estland und Livland abgeschafft wurde. Im restlichen Russland wurde sie erst während der Herrschaft von Zar Alexander II. im Zuge der Agrarreform von 1861 abgeschafft. Der Zar befürchtete damals, dass sich die russischen Bauern ansonsten ihre Freiheit durch eine offene Revolution holen würden.;;;;;;;;;;;x

abolish_slavery_desc;Slavery is legal in our nation, but no slaves are found in our fields. With slavery becoming rarer and rarer in the world, the more liberal and abolitionist sectors of our society could gain enough power to pass a bill in the UH, arguing that ‘abolishing this outdated institution from our country will elevate our us in the eyes of the civilized nations’.

abolish_umar_pact_desc;The Pact of Umar is a 7th century treaty between the Muslims and the Christians of Syria, Mesopotamia, or Jerusalem that later gained a canonical status in Islamic jurisprudence. In general, the pact contains a list of rights and restrictions on non-Muslims (dhimmis). By abiding by them, non-Muslims are granted the security of their persons, their families, and their possessions. Under the pact today, all dhimmis have their religion and status protected - they are free to practice and need not to convert and in return, they pay a tax: the jizya. Abolishing the pact means relinquishing this tax but will enable efforts to convert the non-muslims. It's a path without return which will greatly anger other countries as well as our own dhimmi population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

argentina_claim_falklands_desc;The Malvinas, or, as the English call them, the Falkland Islands, have been occupied by the United Kingdom since 1832. Their claim to the islands hinges on their alledged discovery by Captain John Strong in 1690. Several attempts at settlement were made afterwards, by the French, the British, and the Spanish, but the islands were eventually abandoned by the British in 1774, while Spanish fishermen and gauchos remained. Henceforth, we view their claim as invalid and their occupation as unlawful. We must reassert our claims to these islands and reclaim them for $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

back_to_africa_act_desc;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonization Society was an early advocate of the idea of resettling $COUNTRY_ADJ$-born blacks in Africa. Founded in 1816, it was composed of two core groups: abolitionists and slave owners. Abolitionist members believed in freeing African slaves, along with their descendants, and providing them with the opportunity to return to Africa. Slave owning members believed free blacks endangered the system of slavery and sought to expel them from $COUNTRY$. Their efforts were ultimately fruitless as they didn't attract a significant numbers of colonizers. With the support of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, resettling won't be optional. By signing the 'Back to Africa Act' we can fulfil their purpose, this time through the forceful repatriation of the Afro-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ community in our core territories. It won't be fast and it will attract a lot of negative attention from around the international community, but we can continue on the work of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonization Society in repatriating the African diaspora in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

banjarmasin_war_desc;Since 1606 the East United India Company maintained contacts with the island of Borneo. In 1635 the first contract was signed with the Sultanate of Banjarmasin for the provision of pepper—at the time, a luxury product in Europe and a major reason for the Dutch interest in this region. Over the years, effective power in the Sultanate was increasingly taken up by the Dutch Resident.\n\nIn 1852 the Sultan’s heir-apparent died, and the Dutch replaced him by the illegitimate grandson Tamjied Illah. In vain, Sultan Adam and many nobles sent an emissary to Batavia, pointing out iniquities perpetrated by the Dutch-designated heir and appealing for the Dutch to recognise instead Hidayatullah—a younger but legitimate son.\n\nSultan Adam soon died and was succeeded by the illegitimate Tamjied Illah. There ensued a struggle for power between Tamjied Illah and Hidayatullah, which divided the population, much of which stood behind Hidayatullah and highly resented the Dutch sponsoring of Tamjied Illah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

begin_pax_britannica_desc;Latin for ‘British Peace’\n\n The Napoleonic Wars left Great Britain as the most powerful naval country in the world, with no meaningful rivals. The country’s economic and strategic strength was buttressed by the fleet, localized military action was a staple of the not-entirely-peaceful ‘Pax Britannica’. In addition, the threat of naval force was a significant factor in diplomacy. \n\nDuring the late 19th century, Britain’s primary goal in foreign policy was to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to intervene if that balance was upset. Its secondary goal was to protect its overseas interest in the colonies and dominions, as free trade kept the Empire alive. The sea routes to the colonies, especially those linking Britain to India were vital. \n\n§RNOTE: This will cause Britain to reject all alliances with great powers unless it is threatened by another rising great power.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Funding and engineering was mainly provided by German Empire banks and companies, which in the 1890s had built the Anatolian Railway (Anatolische Eisenbahn) connecting Constantinople, Ankara and Konya. The Ottoman Empire wished to maintain its control of Arabian Peninsula and to expand its influence across the Red Sea into the nominally Ottoman Khedivate of Egypt, which had been under British military control since the Urabi Revolt in 1882.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bring_tea_to_iran_desc;After a failed attempt to cultivate tea in $COUNTRY$ in 1882 with seeds from India, Prince Mohammad Mirza known as "Kashef Al Saltaneh" who was born in Lahijan, imported Indian tea and started its cultivation in Lahijan. Kashef, who was the first mayor of Tehran and an Iranian ambassador to India under British rule, knew that the British would not allow him to learn about the secrets of tea production, as it was it is their biggest business in India. So being fluent in French, the prince pretended to be a French labourer and started to work in the tea plantations and factories to learn how to produce tea. Ultimately his plan was to take back some samples of this tea to $COUNTRY$ to cultivate. He was successful in this endeavour only because of his diplomatic immunity which stopped the British from searching his secretly stashed sample. At the time, Kashef brought 3000 saplings into his country from the Northern part of India, Kangra and he started the cultivation in the region Gilan, south of the Caspian Sea. The climate there was well suited for tea cultivation, and the tea industry quickly expanded in Gilan and Mazanderan region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Over the course of the 19th century this involvement gradually increased. The colonial government was, in particular, interested in fostering trade as this provided it with its main source of revenue, in the form of customs duties and other taxes.

claim_schleswig_desc;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteinian desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII.

clear_out_the_manchu_elite_desc;Since the beginning of the Qing dynasty, the Chinese Imperial administration and bureaucracy had been dominated by a powerful Manchu elite, and the Qing emperors had traditionally discriminated heavily against ethnic Han. In the 1860s, Empress Dowager Cixi effectively ended this practice, when she entrusted the country’s most powerful military unit to a man of Han background, Zeng Guofan, during the suppression of the Taiping rebellion. By getting rid of the Manchu elite, we can take an important step toward modernization.;Depuis le début de la dynastie Qing, l'administration et la bureaucratie de l'Empire chinois sont dominées par une puissante élite mandchoue et les empereurs Qing se sont attachés à discriminer l'ethnie Han.

collectivise_farms_desc;State farms, began to be created in the early 1920s as an ideological example of ‘socialist agriculture of the highest order’. Kolkhozes or collective farms were regarded for a long time as an intermediate stage in the transition to the ideal of state farming. While kolkhozy were typically created by combining small individual farms together in a cooperative structure, a sovkhoz would be organised by the state on land confiscated from former large estates and sovkhoz workers would be recruited from among landless rural residents. The sovkhoz employees would be paid regulated wages, whereas the remuneration system in a kolkhoz relied on cooperative-style distribution of farm earnings (in cash and in kind) among the members. In farms of both types, however, a system of internal passports prevented movement of employees and members from rural areas to urban areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After the permission and promised financial help, the Central-Dombauverein was founded in 1842.

colonization_of_fernando_po_desc;The king, with sufficient advance notice, prepared a reception for the visitors, the kind of reception only he could prepare. From the outskirts of the town to the palace of the mochucu, the street was lined with two long lines of Bubi warriors, daubed with red, with rifles and lances and holding buffalo-skin shields. They cheered for $COUNTRY$. At the end was the aged King Moka, standing next to his throne made of tree trunks. He still looked arrogant and for the reception he had, naturally, put on his best finery: the two-point full-dress hat of a marine official and an old frock coat, but without the trousers. The monkey skin apron hung from his waist, and in his right hand he flaunted his staff of command. To his right was Abba Moote, high priest of the Bubi, with his paddle in his hand, emblem of his dignity. To his left, his first lieutenant, Sas Ebuera. The elderly counsellors and the king’s sixty wives crowded after him. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag Moka had received as a gift waved over the palace door. After two days of conferences and after having exchanged the customary gifts and tightened the bonds between $COUNTRY$ and Moka, the visitors returned to Santa Isabel, not without the governor having granted the king permission to use gunpowder…\n\nThe island of Fernando Pó has been the stage of numerous colonization attempts by the Spanish and the British. The north of the island is home to its only European settlement, founded by the British as a base of operations to end the slave trade in the Atlantic. Despite that, expansion of the colonization efforts have been largely hampered by the Bubi people, unified in a monarchy under king Moka.

conquer_conakry_desc;Since the 18th century, Portuguese, British and French traders had established small stations on the coast which was called Rivières du Sud by the French. The Portuguese had trading stations at Rio Pongo and Rio Nunez, mostly for the purchase of enslaved Africans captured inland and brought to the coast. By 1820, British suppression of the slave trade and Portuguese imperial decline saw these posts abandoned, with British and French traders moving in. The French admiral Bouët-Willaumez made a number of treaties with coastal communities in the area (usually under the threat of force), and ensured Marseilles based trade houses exclusive access to the palm oil trade by the 1840s. Used for making soap, the palm oil trade was with Diola merchants who established markets in the interior, and transported it to the coastal stations.

court_yard_speech_desc;The ‘Courtyard Crisis’ (Swedish: Borggårdskrisen) was a constitutional crisis in Sweden provoked by the reckless cuts in the defence budget promoted by the Liberal government of, then prime minister, Karl Staaf.

create_pakistan_desc;The movement for Muslim self-awakening and identity was started by the Muslim modernist and reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, considered the architect of the two-nation theory. The two-nation theory is the ideology that the primary identity and unifying denominator of Muslims in the South Asian subcontinent is their religion, rather than their language or ethnicity, and therefore Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations, regardless of ethnic or other commonalities. To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was ‘a complete social order which affects all the activities in life’ and ‘where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded’. By recognizing the Two-Nation Theory and the Muslim demand, we will open the path for them to create their own nation in the South Asian subcontinent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cremieux_decree_desc;The Cremieux Decree was a law that gave French citizenship to about 35,000 Jews in French Algeria. It was named for French-Jewish lawyer and Minister of Justice Adolphe Cremieux, who had founded the Alliance Israelite Universelle a decade earlier. \n\n At the same time the naturalization regime in French Algeria was confirmed in Decree 137, determining that Muslims are not French citizens in the French colony of Algeria. The aim was to maintain the status quo, the sovereignty of France over its North African colonies. Five years later, in 1875, this was confirmed in the framework of the Code de l’indigenat. \n\n The decree allowed for native Jews to automatically become French citizens while Muslim Arabs and Berbers were excluded and remained under the second-class indigenous status outlined in the Code de l’Indigenat. They could, on paper, request French citizenship, but requests were very seldom accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

devil_island_desc;Le Bagne de Cayenne, Devil’s Island, was a famous prison of the 19th and 20th century which operated in the tropical colony of French Guiana.

Only a small minority of broken survivors returned to France to tell how horrible it was;they sometimes scared other potential criminals to go straight.

In response to these events, the poet and merchant Max Schneckenburger wrote a patriotic poem calling on the ‘Fatherland to remain calm’, for, as the poem says, ‘fast and true stands the watch at the Rhine’, implying that the German nation would defend the river against any and all aggression. The poem was put to music in 1854, and became extremely popular in Germany during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dissolve_the_upper_house_desc;Supreme executive power in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state emanates from $CAPITAL$, through the figure of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch. The absolute monarch is the final authority in all matters of the state, but the bureaucracy and the military are the pillars that sustain the absolutist government. In addition, the landed aristocracy, which often acts as the bureaucracy, expects and receives positions of power in the government, positions appointed by the monarch. This is necessary for the normal function of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state—the aristocrats are the governor generals, the privy-councillors, the high-ranking bureaucrats, the ministers, the judges and the executors of the monarch’s decisions. For these functions, several government institutions exist and are populated by the landed nobility—the Committee of Ministers of $COUNTRY$, the Governing Senate, the State Council. They help draft and apply laws, manage foreign and internal policy, plan wars and administer the military, advise the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch as well as judge and administer justice. The monarch still can and has the final say in all these matters, and is his royal prerogative to do away the currently appointed aristocrats and pick new ones. By taking this step—effectively dissolving the upper house and appointing new ministers—the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch can surround himself with sycophants and petty nobility that are willing to do whatever he wants them to do—for a time, at least. This break in the unspoken agreement between the monarch and the bureaucrats, the monarch and the aristocracy, will bring consequences—besides exposing internal fractures in the government to the international community, it is sure to anger the nobles and sow confusion throughout the government ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

drain_the_eastern_pinsk_marshes_desc;Much of the swampiest parts of Russia, the so called "Russian bolota", lie in Byelorussia, Northern Ukraine and the European north-west, coinciding with the areas of earliest permanent, Russian settlement. It might be expected, therefore, that land reclamation in Russia commenced at an early date. The eighteenth century saw well-developed trade between Russia and Holland and also an influx of many German farmers and engineers, aware of reclamation work accomplished in their homeland. In fact reclamation in Russia only took place in the nineteenth century and not until the last quarter of that century did it reach significant proportions. The explanation appears to be, quite simply, that the cost of reclamation was not worthwhile, as long as rich chernozem soils were awaiting colonization to the south and east. In the nineteenth century the situation changed. The chernozem belt of European Russia was densely settled and population movements from this belt to the Siberian steppe were gathering increasing momentum. In chernozem and non-chernozem zones alike, the growing population was putting ever greater pressure on available arable and even more on available hayland and pasture. Land-reclamation projects were first initiated in 1872 by a state-sponsored "Western expedition for the drainage of swamps", led by the Russian scholar I.I. Zhilinsky. By the late 19th century drainage of the marshes recovered 1.5 million hectares of wetlands for use as pasture and farmland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

drain_the_pinsk_marshes_desc;The Pinsk Marshes cover more than 269,400 sq. km, surrounding the sandy lowlands of the dense network of rivers and rivulets forming on both sides of the Pripyat River, one of the main tributaries of the Dnieper. The marshes undergo substantial changes in size during the year, with melting snows in springtime and autumn rainfall causing extensive flooding as the river overflows. As in most wetlands in Europe, the Pinsk Marshes are seen as an unhealthy area, a focus of maladies. Historically, during most of the year, the marshes are virtually impassable to major military forces, thus influencing strategic planning of all military operations in the region. Now that we have completed vast amounts of land reclamation in Southwestern Belarus and East Bank of Ukraine, equipped ourselves with latest engineering technology and knowledge, we can begin the difficult work of draining the much more difficult, wilder heartland of Pripyat marshes and wetlands in the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

embrace_the_boer_desc;The Dutch East Indies company rule in South Africa was tyrannical: they closed the colony against free immigration, kept the whole of the trade in its own hands, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers in one body, prescribed to the farmers the nature of the crops they were to grow, demanded from them a large part of their produce, and harassed them with other exactions tending to discourage industry and enterprise. The effect of this tyranny was inevitable: it drove men to desperation. They fled from oppression, and thus trekking began. The colony changed hands but many of the Boer farmers were as dissatisfied with British rule as they had been with the Dutch East India Company, though their ground of complaint was not the same. By making amends with the Boer farmers, paying compensation, abolishing Company rule and administrating the colonies directly, we can make amends and make the Boers accept our rule, to finally put an end to the trekking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

enact_female_suffrage_desc;The idea of Woman’s Suffrage increasingly gained traction in Western society throughout the 19th century. First advocated in the writings of early liberal philosophers, such as England’s Mary Wollstonecraft or John Stuart Mill, the idea and ideology of Woman’s Suffrage gradually developed, as the century wore on, into a coherent ideology in its own right: Feminism. The experience during The First World War, of women working in factories, and other jobs previously reserved for men during peacetime, is often said to have been a crucial pivot point in securing Woman’s right to work, vote, and, in other fields of society, achieve legal equality with men.;Au XIXe siècle, la question du droit de vote des femmes gagne de plus en plus de terrain. Initialement défendue dans les écrits des premiers philosophes libéraux, parmi lesquels les britanniques Mary Woolstonecraft ou John Stuart Mill, l'idée du droit de vote des femmes s'est progressivement répandue au fil du siècle pour donner lieu à une idéologie à part entière : le féminisme. L'expérience de la Première Guerre mondiale, lorsque les femmes travaillèrent en usine et exercèrent des métiers jusque là réservés aux hommes, serait l'un des pivots du droit des femmes à travailler, à voter et, dans d'autres domaines de la société, à atteindre un statut d'égalité avec les hommes.;Die Idee des Frauenwahlrechts fasste im Verlauft des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts in der westlichen Gesellschaft immer mehr Fuß.

By establishing our dominance over these provinces, we can expel the Russian rulers and annex them back to the Ottoman Empire, centralizing rule and restoring order to these territories that belong in our empire. They can, however, resist, which would lead to war with them and potentially any Great Powers that support them.

On the other hand, if he chose to dispose of a parcel of land, the serfs associated with that land stayed with it to serve their new lord, benefiting him with their long-acquired knowledge of practices suited to the land. Further, a serf could not abandon his lands without permission, nor did he possess a saleable title in them.

expel_manchu_from_primorye_desc;The Pacific coast near Haishenwai was settled mainly by the Chinese and Manchus during the Qing Dynasty period. The Manchus banned Han Chinese from most of Manchuria including the Haishenwai area-it was only visited by illegal gatherers of sea cucumbers. Our claims on the area grew strong and we took the area, founded new settlements and renamed it. But the Manchus are still a majority in most of Outer Manchuria and we can’t force them to assimilate. Our advisers recommend that we should try to throw them out so we can strengthen our claim in the area. Should we succeed in expelling them, we can greatly increase the region attractiveness to immigrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

When both the Cabinet and the National Assembly refused his wish, Pedro threatened to abdicate the imperial throne and join the army as a volunteer, reportedly saying that ‘If they can prevent me from going as an Emperor, they cannot prevent me from abdicating and going as a Fatherland Volunteer’. Naturally, the Cabinet was left without much choice. Brazilians who later volunteered during the war were called ‘Fatherland Volunteers’, in memory of Pedro’s quote.

Face au refus du cabinet et de l'assemblée nationale d'accéder à sa demande, Pierre II menaça d'abdiquer pour rejoindre l'armée en tant que volontaire et il tint les propos suivants : 'S'ils peuvent m'empêcher d'être empereur, ils ne peuvent m'empêcher d'abdiquer et de rejoindre les volontaires de la patrie.'

Also sowohl das Kabinett als auch die Nationalversammlung seinen Wunsch ablehnte, drohte Peter II. damit, abzudanken und als Freiwilliger in die Armee einzutreten. Er soll gesagt haben: 'Wenn sie mich daran hindern können, als Kaiser zu gehen, dann können sie mich nicht daran hindern, abzudanken und als vaterländischer Freiwilliger zu gehen'.

It represents the first advanced civilization in mainland Greece, with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art and writing system. \n\nThe Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, the Linear B, offers the first written records of the Greek language and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon.\n\nMycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax. Mycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Much like Mitteleuropa, it articulated Germany’s foreign policy aims at the end of the long 19th century. The difference between the two was that Mittelafrika would be an agglomeration of German colonies in Africa, while Mitteleuropa was conceptualised as a geostrategic buffer zone between Germany and Russia to be filled with puppet states. \n\nGerman strategic thinking was that if the region between the colonies of German East Africa, German South-West Africa, and Cameroon could be annexed, a contiguous entity could be created covering the breadth of the African continent from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Given the richness in natural resources of the Belgian Congo alone, this region would accrue considerable wealth to the colonising power through the exploitation of natural resources, as well as contributing to another German aim of economic self-sufficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Pourtant, avec la montée du nationalisme au XIXe siècle, l'unification aurait été possible bien avant cela, comme en témoigne l'assemblée de Francfort de 1848. Dans les années 1860, la Prusse et l'Autriche, qui se disputaient la position dominante au sein d'une grande Allemagne, formèrent chacune leur propre confédération d'États allemands : les États du sud de l'Allemagne et la Confédération de l'Allemagne du nord.

Während der 1860er Jahre wetteiferten Preußen und Österreich, die beiden größten deutschsprachigen Mächte, hauptsächlich um die Vormachtstellung im Großdeutschen Reich.

form_pakistan_desc;The movement for Muslim self-awakening and identity was started by the Muslim modernist and reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, considered the architect of the two-nation theory. The two-nation theory is the ideology that the primary identity and unifying denominator of Muslims in the South Asian subcontinent is their religion, rather than their language or ethnicity, and therefore Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations, regardless of ethnic or other commonalities. To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was ‘a complete social order which affects all the activities in life’ and ‘where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded’. To guarantee the Muslim population of the South Asian subcontinent will not be dominated by Hindus and to guarantee they will have a place in society, it would be under our best interests to assert our hegemony in the area and create a nation for all Muslims in South Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Pourtant, avec la montée du nationalisme au XIXe siècle, l'unification aurait été possible bien avant cela, comme en témoigne l'assemblée de Francfort de 1848. Dans les années 1860, la Prusse et l'Autriche, qui se disputaient la position dominante au sein d'une grande Allemagne, formèrent chacune leur propre confédération d'États allemands : les États du sud de l'Allemagne et la Confédération de l'Allemagne du nord.

Während der 1860er Jahre wetteiferten Preußen und Österreich, die beiden größten deutschsprachigen Mächte, hauptsächlich um die Vormachtstellung im Großdeutschen Reich.

The new capital city site was 66 sq. km in area, surrounded by four rivers. The plan called for a 144-square block grid patterned citadel, anchored by a 16 square block royal palace compound at the centre by Mandalay Hill. The 1020-acre citadel was to be surrounded by four 2,032 m long walls and a moat 64 m wide, 4.6 m deep. At intervals of 169 m along the wall, turrets were built with gold-tipped spires for watchmen. The walls had three gates on each side, and five bridges to cross the moat. In addition, the king also commissioned the Kuthodaw Pagoda, the Pahtan-haw Shwe Thein upasampada hall, the Thudamma ‘Good Dharma’ zayats or public houses for preaching Buddhism and a library for the Pali Canon. The former royal palace of Amarapura was dismantled and moved by elephants to the new location at the foot of Mandalay.

golden_law_desc;The Lei Áurea (Golden Law) was sanctioned by Isabel, Imperial Princess of Brazil, who was regent at the time while her father, Emperor Dom Pedro II, was in Europe. It was signed on May 13, 1888 and was the law that abolished slavery in Brazil. It had only two articles. The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves – Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. The Brazilian government was also under pressure from Britain, who sought to end the slave trade in order to expand production in its own colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status. Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy.

jamaican_crown_colony_desc;Although the black uprising of the Morant Bay rebellion had been ruthlessly suppressed, the severe rioting so alarmed the white Jamaican planters that the two-centuries-old assembly voted to abolish itself and asked for the establishment of direct British rule.\n\nIn $YEAR$ the new Crown colony government consisted of the Legislative Council and the executive Privy Council containing members of both chambers of the House of Assembly, but the Colonial Office exercised effective power through a presiding British governor. The council included a few handpicked prominent Jamaicans for the sake of appearance only. In the late nineteenth century, Crown colony rule was modified representation and limited self-rule were reintroduced gradually into Jamaica. The colony’s legal structure was reformed along the lines of English common law and county courts, and a constabulary force was established.\n\nThe smooth working of the Crown colony system was dependent on a good understanding and an identity of interests between the governing officials, who were British, and most of the nonofficial, nominated members of the Legislative Council, who were Jamaicans. The elected members of this body were in a permanent minority and without any influence or administrative power. The unstated alliance – based on shared colour, attitudes, and interest – between the British officials and the Jamaican upper class was reinforced in London, where the West India Committee lobbied for Jamaican interests. Jamaica’s white or near-white propertied class continued to hold the dominant position in every respect the vast majority of the black population remained poor and unenfranchised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jules_ferry_laws_desc;French education during the 19th century was marked by two distinct and segregated systems, the first being a secondary school system and the second a primary school system. However, in each of these systems, the Catholic Church provided an alternative to secular schooling that was often the only option for families in economically depressed regions of France. \n\nThe Jules Ferry Laws were a set of French Laws which established free education, then mandatory and laic (secular) education. Jules Ferry, a lawyer holding the office of Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, was widely credited for creating the modern Republican school (l'école républicaine). The dual system of state and church schools that were largely staffed by religious officials was replaced by state schools and lay school teachers. The educational reforms enacted by Jules Ferry are often attributed to a broader anti-clerical campaign in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Pope Pius IX refused to accept the laws, which were seen by both him and his successors as an infringement of the independence of the Holy See. While the issue was not conclusively solved until the Lateran Treaty of 1929, the Law of Guarantees nevertheless meant that the young Kingdom’s capital would from then on be Rome.;En 1870, la «Loi des garanties» fut passée par le tout jeune royaume d’Italie pour résoudre la «question romaine». Cette loi accordait au pape des privilèges équivalents à ceux du roi, y compris le droit de recevoir et de nommer des ambassadeurs. Le pape Pie IX refusa la loi, que lui-même et ses successeurs considéraient comme une atteinte à l'indépendance du Saint Siège. Si la question ne fut définitivement réglée qu’en 1929 avec le Traité de Latran, la loi des garanties a néanmoins établi que la capitale du nouveau royaume serait Rome.;Mit dem im Jahr 1870 vom neu gegründeten Königreich Italien verabschiedeten 'Garantiegesetz' sollte die 'Römische Frage' gelöst werden.

Papst Pius IX. lehnte das Gesetz ab, das er und seine Nachfolger als Schmälerung der Unabhängigkeit des Heiligen Stuhls betrachteten.

megali_idea_desc;The ‘Megali Idea’, the Great Idea, was an irredentist conception of a Greater Greek state encompassing all ethnic Greeks, including in particular the substantial Greek minorities living on the Western Coast of Asia Minor. The concept was a driving force between much of Greece’s interactions with the fading Ottoman state during the 19th century, and the goals of the Great Idea came very close to a realization in the Treaty of Sèvres, signed at the end of World War One. The vast land gains that the Treaty of Sèvres accorded to Greece were however largely undone by the following Greco-Turkish war of 1919-21. Big is beautiful!;L’idée «Megali», la grande idée, est une conception irrédentiste d’une Grande Nation grecque qui rassemblerait tous les peuples d’ethnie grecque, en particulier la substantielle minorité vivant sur la côte occidentale de l’Asie mineure. Cette idée motiva la plupart des interactions de la Grèce ave l'Empire ottoman agonisant au cours du XIXe siècle et l'objectif de création d'une Grande Grèce fut bien près d'être atteint lors de la signature du Traité de Sèvre, à la fin de la Première guerre mondiale. Les vastes portions de territoire que le Traité de Sèvre accorda à la Grèce, furent largement perdues dans la guerre gréco-turque qui suivit entre 1919-1921. Big is beautiful!;Die 'Megail-Idee', die Große Idee, war eine irredentistische Vorstellung von einem Großgriechischen Staat, der alle Griechischstämmigen umfassen sollte, besonders die großen griechischen Minderheiten, die an der Westküste Kleinasiens lebten. Dieses Konzept war eine treibende Kraft hinter den griechischen Interaktionen mit dem im Niedergang befindlichen osmanischen Staat während des 19. Jahrhunderts, und im Vertrag von Sèvres, der am Ende des ersten Weltkriegs unterzeichnet wurde, kam man den Zielen der Großen Idee schon sehr nahe. Die weitläufigen Gebiete, die durch den Vertrag von Sèvres erlangt wurden, gingen im griechisch-türkischen Krieg von 1919-21 aber größtenteils wieder verloren.;;;;;;;;;;;x

meiji_daijokan_ordinances_desc;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government announced the reformation of the land taxation system in $YEAR$ as part of the Daijokan Ordinances in Japan. The government initially ordered individual farmers to measure the plots of their land themselves, calculate their taxes, and submit the results to local tax officials. However, difficulties arose with the honesty of the measuring system when the budget showed that collected taxes fell far below projected values. Private land ownership was recognized for the first time in Japan with the issuing of land titles. The previous practice of land ownership was the Public Land Public Citizen Laws, which stated that all land was under the sole ownership of the emperor, such that individual farmers were merely borrowing the land from feudal lords, who in turn were borrowing the land from the emperor. The reform abolished this archaic system of land ownership, and began to allow landowners to use their property as a financial asset in collateral or other investment. This law was one of the first steps towards the development of capitalism in Japan, paralleling the English statute Quia Emptores enacted several centuries earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

melayu_raya_desc;Melayu Raya’ is the name of the all-archipelago nationalist movement in South East Asia that supported the idea of one single country uniting the Malay people rather than split into several colonies. As such, it ambitioned the union of the East Indies, Dutch, British and Portuguese into a country strong enough to fight off western imperialism. The Pan-Malay union was based on understandings on similarities in race, shared language, religion and culture among ethnic groups. The ancient concept of Alam Melayu or Nusantara advocates an historical awareness that the territories were once united, to a degree, under native empires and, as such, could and should be brought together once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Their syllabic script, the Linear B, offers the first written records of the Greek language and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon.\n\nMycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax. Mycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In the mid-19th century the Russians would expand beyond this border to seize the vast lands between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River. The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor’s summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov’s gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia.

He had long ago formed the view that this required a war against Austria, in his view, war with Austria could bring France military success, delivering glory to France and humiliation to Austria. \n\nThe prime-minister of Piedmont, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, aware of the French objectives believes there is an opportunity to serve these, while at the same time fulfilling his own by removing the burdensome yoke of Austrian repression from as many Italian citizens as possible. \n\nWe should propose a meeting with the French Emperor as soon as the opportunity arises;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

pompeji_fiorelli_desc;Since the rediscovery of Pompeii in the 18th century, treasure-hunters, tomb raiders and adventurers have searched for valuable artefacts in the old roman civitas. A new generation of archaeologists, diligent and experienced in new techniques and with a broader consciousness of scientific approaches, awaits to start new excavations. Giuseppe Fiorelli—one of those archaeologists, and a patriot, too—will develop a new kind of conservation and excavation in the Campanian fields, from which our nation and science will benefit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

population_exchanges_desc;With the intervention of the League of Nations, we might be able to broker a deal to settle our borders, our disputes and our populations with the Turks. The Turkish government representatives say that the ‘amelioration of the lot of the minorities in Turkey’ depended ‘above all on the exclusion of every kind of foreign intervention and of the possibility of provocation coming from outside’. This could be achieved most effectively with an exchange, and ‘the best guarantees for the security and development of the minorities remaining’ after the exchange ‘would be those supplied both by the laws of the country and by the liberal policy of Turkey with regard to all communities whose members have not deviated from their duty as Turkish citizens’. An exchange would also be useful as a response to violence in the Balkans: ‘there were’, in any event, ‘over a million Turks without food or shelter in countries in which neither Europe nor America took nor was willing to take any interest’. The population exchange is seen as the best form of minority protection as well as ‘the most radical and humane remedy’ of all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

portugal-brazil_desc;The United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves was formed in 1815, following the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil during the Napoleonic invasions of Portugal, and it continued to exist for about one year after the return of the Court to Europe, being de facto dissolved in 1822, when Brazil proclaimed its independence. The dissolution of the United Kingdom was accepted by Portugal and formalized de jure in 1825, when Portugal recognized the independent Empire of Brazil. Now, with both Portugal and Brazil in our domain, we can recreate this union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

portuguese_civil_code_desc;In $YEAR$, the first Portuguese Civil Code was enacted. Professor Seabra, influenced by the Code Napoleon, wrote the whole Code alone. Other Codifications were also studied and taken into consideration, especially the Allgemeines Landrecht (Prussia), the ABGB (Austria) and the Sardinian Civil Code. But he was able to create a very peculiar style: the systematization is different from the French Code. The Portuguese Civil Code was unique for European civil codes, in its characterization of laws in terms of the person and property. It was divided into four sections: the person, the acquisition of goods, goods, and the defence of those goods or rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

privatise_farms_desc;State farms, began to be created in the early 1920s as an ideological example of ‘socialist agriculture of the highest order’. Kolkhozes or collective farms were regarded for a long time as an intermediate stage in the transition to the ideal of state farming. While kolkhozy were typically created by combining small individual farms together in a cooperative structure, a sovkhoz would be organised by the state on land confiscated from former large estates and sovkhoz workers would be recruited from among landless rural residents. The sovkhoz employees would be paid regulated wages, whereas the remuneration system in a kolkhoz relied on cooperative-style distribution of farm earnings (in cash and in kind) among the members. In farms of both types, however, a system of internal passports prevented movement of employees and members from rural areas to urban areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

We would gain control over western Wallonia as well as the region around Brussels. The British originally rejected this idea, but what could be the harm in asking them again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

prussian_settlement_commission_desc;The Prussian Settlement Commission was a Prussian government commission that operated from 1886. It was set up by Otto von Bismarck to increase land ownership by Germans at the expense of Poles, by economic and political means, in the German Empire’s eastern provinces of West Prussia and the Posen as part of his larger efforts aiming at the eradication of the Polish nation. \n\nThe Commission was one of Prussia’s prime instruments in the official policy of Germanization of the historically Polish lands of West Prussia (the former Royal Prussia) and the dissolved Grand Duchy of Posen. The Commission ultimately purchased 613 estates from German owners and 214 from Poles, functioning to bail out German debtors often rather than fulfilling its declared national mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

reforms_of_abdul_hamid_ii_desc;Abdul Hamid II was the 34th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He oversaw a period of decline, with rebellions, particularly in the Balkans, he suspended both the Ottoman constitution and Parliament in $YEAR$ and accomplished highly effective power and control. \n\nModernisation of the Ottoman Empire occurred during his reign, including reform of the bureaucracy, the extension of the Rumelia Railway and Anatolia Railway and the construction of the Baghdad Railway and Hejaz Railway. In addition, a system for population registration and control over the press was established along with the first local modern law school in 1898. The most far-reaching of these reforms were in education: many professional schools were established, including Law School, School of Arts, School of Trades, Civil Engineering School, The Veterinarian School, The Customs School, The Farming School, The Linguistic School, and more.\n\nAbdul Hamid II attached utmost importance to the reorganization of the military. As early as 1880 he sought, and two years later secured, German assistance, which culminated in the appointment of Lt. Col.

reforms_of_abdulmejid_i_desc;Sultan Abdulmejid I enjoyed several years of peace, which enabled him to form a powerful and well-disciplined army that was established at the beginning of the year $YEAR$.\n\nThe chain-of-command in the general staff of each army was composed of a commander-in-chief, two lieutenant-generals, three brigadiers of infantry, one of whom commands the reserve, two brigadiers of cavalry, and one brigadier of artillery. In each corps there were three regiments of infantry, two of cavalry, and one of artillery, with thirty-three guns. The total strength of these twelve regiments of active forces was 30,000 men, but it was diminished in time of peace by furlough to an effective strength of about 25,000 men in three of the six armies, as well as 15,000 troops in the other three, a consequence of the recruiting system being as yet incomplete in its application all over the Ottoman Empire. The whole establishment of this branch amounts, therefore, to 180,000 men, belonging to the active service, but its effective strength is at present 123,000.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

repeal_the_corn_laws_desc;The ‘Corn Laws’ were a series of vastly unpopular tariffs, often described as a rare example of British mercantilism, designed to ‘protect’ British farmers and corn prices from cheap foreign competition, which, naturally, had the effect of effectively increasing corn prices for Britain’s poor. After the failed harvest of 1845, and the following Potato Famine in Ireland, the Corn Laws were finally repealed in 1846. The failure of these tariffs heralded a long period of British commitment to the ideals of Laissez-faire capitalism, that was to last for most of the 19th century.;Les 'lois sur le grain' regroupaient une série de droits de douanes très impopulaires, souvent décrites comme un rare exemple de mercantilisme britannique, conçues pour 'protéger' les fermiers anglais et les prix du blé de la concurrence étrangère, ce qui, naturellement, avait pour effet d'augmenter les prix du blé pour les plus pauvres. Après la mauvaise récolte de 1845 et la Grande Famine irlandaise, les lois sur le grain finirent par être abrogées en 1846. L'échec de ces droits de douane marqua le début d'une longue période d'engagement britannique à l'égard des idéaux du capitalisme laxiste qui allait perdurer pendant presque tout le XIXe siècle.;Die 'Korngesetze' waren eine Reihe äußerst unbeliebter Zollabgaben, die oft als seltenes Beispiel für britischen Merkantilismus beschrieben wurden. Mit diesen Einfuhrzöllen sollte die britische Landwirtschaft vor der billigen ausländischen Konkurrenz 'geschützt' werden, aber natürlich erhöhte dies den Armen Englands nur die Kornpreise. Nach der Missernte von 1845 und der darauf folgenden Kartoffel-Hungersnot in Irland wurden die Korngesetze 1846 endlich aufgehoben. Das Scheitern dieser Zölle leite eine lange Periode britischer Verbundenheit mit den Idealen des Laissez Faire-Kapitalismus ein, die den Großteil des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts überspannte.;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Treaty of Paucarpata agreed to the devolution of all captured ships by Chile, the restoration of commercial relations between the Confederation and Chile, the withdrawal of all Chilean troops from Confederate territories and the payment by the Confederacy of the former Peruvian foreign debts with Chile. The Chilean troops were reembarked. When Admiral Blanco Encalada returned rather ignominiously to Valparaíso with the fleet and the army in December, 1837, the scandal was gigantic. The Chilean government and the Chilean public opinion repudiated the treaty in indignation. Admiral Blanco Encalada as was thrown into jail and tried for high treason, together with his advisor Antonio José de Irisarri, who had refused to even return to Chile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The main policies enacted were:\nThe conscription law, incorporating the Finnish army into the imperial army.\nThe Language Manifesto of $YEAR$ which made Russian the language of administration of Finland.\nThe Orthodox Russian Church was the church of state, including, for example, criminalizing the act of subjecting a follower of the Orthodox church to a Lutheran church service.\nThe Manifesto of $YEAR$ which asserted the imperial government’s right to rule Finland without the consent of local legislative bodies, including press censorship and restrictions of Russian currency and stamps as the only ones allowed.\nOur Finnish subjects will surely not like this and they might try to resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

russify_baltic_states_desc;The Russian press took up the topic of German influence in the Baltic provinces. As early as the 1860s, the Slavophiles demanded the end of the autonomy in the Baltic provinces and a standardized administration. The unification of Germany and its subsequent development into a Great Power considerably increased the military-strategic importance of the Estonian and Latvian territories which bordered the Baltic Sea, between the extensively autonomous Finland and the rebellious Poland-Lithuania. The security of the capital St Petersburg became a serious issue for the Russian Empire. Tsarist Russia’s government circles were afraid of the Baltic German’s possible orientation towards Germany, especially worrying was the thought that by Germanizing the Estonians and Latvians, the Germans could become the majority nation in the Baltics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shinbutsu_bunri_desc;The Japanese term shinbutsu bunri indicates the separation of Shinto from Buddhism, introduced after the Meiji Restoration, and therefore the separation of kami (native Shinto deities) from Buddhas (Buddhist deities), and of Buddhist temples from Shinto shrines (jinja). Until the end of the Edo period Shinto and Buddhism were intimately connected in what was called shinbutsu-shugo, to the point that the same buildings were often used as both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, and Shinto gods were interpreted as manifestations of Buddhas. The new government saw shinbutsu bunri as a way to reduce the immense wealth and power of the Buddhist sects. At the same time, it was supposed to give Shinto, and especially its cult of the Emperor, time to grow into an effective vehicle for nationalism. A first order issued by the Jingijimuka on $YEAR$ ordered the defrocking of shaso and betto (shrine monks performing Buddhist rites at Shinto shrines). A few days later, the Daijokan banned the application of Buddhist terminology such as gongen to Japanese kami and the veneration of Buddhist statues in shrines. Next came a ban on applying the Buddhist term Daibosatsu (Great Bodhisattva) to the syncretic kami Hachiman at the Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu and Usa Hachiman-gu shrines. In the final stage, all the defrocked betto and shaso were told to become ‘shrine priests’ (kannushi) and return to their shrines. Also, monks of the Nichiren sect were told not to refer to some deities as kami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

singapore_strategy_desc;The Singapore strategy was a naval defence policy of the British Empire that evolved in a series of war plans from 1919 to 1941. It aimed to deter aggression by the Empire of Japan by providing for a base for a fleet of the Royal Navy in the Far East, able to intercept and defeat a Japanese force heading south towards India or Australia. To be effective it required a well-equipped base;Singapore, at the eastern end of the Strait of Malacca, was chosen in 1919 as the location of this base;work continued on this naval base and its defences over the next two decades. The planners envisaged that a war with Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms.;;;;;;;;;;;x

support_french_foreign_legion_desc;‘La Légion Étrangère’, known in English as ‘The Foreign Legion’, is military unit of the French army, with a unique distinction in that it accepts its recruits regardless of their national and personal backgrounds. While originally established as early as 1830, the Legion did not win the lasting legacy it enjoys today until it had seen action during, among others, The Spanish Carlist Wars, The French Intervention in Mexico, the Battle of Camarón, the Franco-Prussian war and, in fact, almost every conflict involving France up until and through the modern era. The image of the young man, perhaps on the run from some personal tragedy, oppression, debt or a criminal past, who joins the French Foreign Legion to serve a tour of personal redemption in the deserts of French Algeria, has since become one of the most iconic and enduring images of the 19th century. Promote the Legion, and see recruits flock to our banners.;La Légion étrangère est une unité militaire de l'armée française qui se distingue par le recrutement de ses membres quelles que soient leur nationalité ou leur histoire personnelle. Initialement formée dans les années 1830, la Légion étrangère gagna véritablement ses galons lors des guerres espagnoles carlistes, de l'intervention française au Mexique, de la bataille de Camarón, de la guerre franco-prusse ainsi que pratiquement tous les conflits impliquant la France et ce, jusqu'à nos jours. L'image du jeune homme, peut-être en proie à une tragédie personnelle, à une oppression, à une dette ou à un passé criminel, qui rejoint la Légion étrangère en guise de rédemption dans les déserts de l'Algérie française, est l'une des images les plus symboliques du XIXe siècle. Promouvez la Légion et accueillez de nouvelles recrues sous nos drapeaux.;La Légion étrangère' ist der französische Ausdruck für die 'Fremdenlegion', eine Einheit der französischen Armee. Sie ist einzigartig dahingehend, dass sie Rekruten aus allen Nationen und persönlichen Hintergründen akzeptiert. Die Fremdenlegion wurde ursprünglich im Jahr 1830 gegründet, aber ihren heutigen Ruf erkämpfte sie sich erst durch Einsätze in den spanischen Karlistenkriegen, bei der französischen Intervention in Mexiko, der Schlacht von Camarón, dem deutsch-französischen Krieg und eigentlich fast jedem anderen Konflikt Frankreichs. Die Vorstellung von einem jungen Mann, der vielleicht vor einer persönlichen Tragödie, Unterdrückung, Schulden oder einer kriminellen Vergangenheit flieht und der französischen Fremdenlegion beitritt, um durch seinen Dienst in den Wüsten des französischen Algeriens seine persönliche Erlösung zu finden, ist seither zu einer der ikonischsten und dauerhaftesten des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts geworden.

tanzimat_reforms_desc;‘Tanzimat’ Turkish for ‘reorganization’ was a series of reforms enacted by the Ottoman state during the latter half of the 19th century, designed to counteract the rising tides of nationalism among the Empire’s vast and varied ethnic minorities.

While the Tanzimat was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the decline of the Ottoman state, it can nevertheless be argued that the reforms at least postponed it.;Les réformes de 'Tanzimat', le mot turc qui signifie 'réorganisation', furent adoptées par l'État ottoman, au cours de la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle, en réaction contre la montée du nationalisme au sein des diverses minorités ethniques de l'empire. Ces réformes visaient à intégrer la population sous la bannière commune d'Ottomanisme en promouvant l'État ottoman comme alternative à l'ethnicité basée sur les États de la nation que bon nombre de minorités radicales, au sein même de l'empire, cherchaient à établir, et en y accordant une représentation et une autonomie plus large. Alors que les réformes de 'Tanzimat' ne parvinrent pas à prévenir le déclin de l'État ottoman, force est de constater qu'elles le retardèrent.;'Tanzimat' ist Türkisch für 'Neuorganisation'. So wurde eine Reihe von Reformen bezeichnet, die der osmanische Staat während des zweiten Hälfte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts auf den Weg brachte, um den steigenden Nationalismusgefühlen der zahlreichen und unterschiedlichen ethnischen Minderheiten des Reichs entgegen zu wirken. Die Reformen zielten auf die Integration der verschiedenen Bevölkerungen unter dem gemeinsamen Banner des 'Osmanismus' ab, indem der osmanische Staat als Alternative für die auf Volkszugehörigkeit basierenden Nationalstaaten präsentiert wurde, die viele der radikalisierten Minderheiten damals bilden wollten. Die Hauptargumente waren dabei eine stärkere Repräsentation und Autonomie innerhalb des osmanischen Staats. Während die Tanzimat den Niedergang des osmanischen Reichs nicht verhindern konnte, so zögerten ihn die Reformen zumindest etwas hinaus.;;;;;;;;;;;x

tasmania_penal_colony_desc;In 1803 the island south of Australia was colonized by the British as a penal colony with the name Van Diemen’s Land, and became part of the British colony of New South Wales. Male convicts served their sentences as assigned labour to free settlers or in gangs assigned to public works. Only the most difficult convicts (mostly re-offenders) were sent to the Tasman Peninsula prison known as Port Arthur. Female convicts were assigned as servants in free settler households or sent to a female factory (women’s workhouse prison). There were five female factories in Van Diemen’s Land. Convicts completing their sentences or earning their ticket-of-leave often promptly left Van Diemen’s Land. Many settled in the new free colony of Victoria, to the dismay of the free settlers in towns such as Melbourne.\n\nWe can abolish the penal colony and convert the island to a regular colony. Changing the name to Tasmania from Van Diemen’s Land should help our government to clear a little bit of the stigma that the island has.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tea_in_georgia_desc;Konstantin Popov, a wealthy merchant in charge of almost the entire Russian imperial tea trade, became interested in the idea of growing tea along the Black Sea coast. He bought vast plots in Chakvi, not far from Batumi, and dreamt of establishing massive plantations with internationally—competitive exports. In 1892, he travelled to China in order to study large-scale tea production. Popov hired a team of experienced workers from a factory in Guangdong, including an ambitious director named Lao Junzhou. With a few financial incentives and concessions, we can expand the tea business to start large scale tea production in a few of our provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

thai_constitution_desc;The Rattanakosin Kingdom and the four traditionally counted preceding kingdoms, collectively called Siam, had an uncodified constitution until $YEAR$. In the preamble to the Penal Code King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) stated: ‘In the ancient times the monarchs of the Siamese nation governed their people with laws which were originally derived from the Dhamasustra of Manu, which was then the prevailing law among the inhabitants of India and the neighbouring countries.\n\nThe constitution continued to state that sovereign power belonged to the people of Siam. However, unlike the temporary charter, the monarchy would now be the direct exerciser of that power, rather than the branches of government. This royal power would be exercised by and with the advice and consent of the People’s Assembly, the State Council (the cabinet), and the courts. However, the monarchy lacked any say in the composition of any of the branches of government and the royal veto could still be overruled. The monarchy was also made ‘sacred and inviolable’, in contrast to the temporary charter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_1854_plan_desc;Born into a lower-middle-class family in Lille, Louis Faidherbe is a sub-director of engineers in the colonies of Senegal. He plays a central role in the implementation of ‘The Plan of $YEAR$’: a series of ministerial orders given to Governor Protet of Senegal that originated in petitions from the powerful Boudreaux-based Maurel and Prom company, the largest shipping interest in Saint-Louis. The plan specified in detail the creation of forts along the Sénégal River to end African control of the acacia gum trade from the interior. Faidherbe’s push to build fortifications farther out generated conflicts with Protet, and his protests to Paris over Protet’s inaction quickly awarded him some sympathy in the government. If we were to appoint him to chef de bataillon and then governor of the colony, we could quickly put the plan in action and take control of the coastal Wolof kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_aceh_question_desc;For much of the 19th century, Aceh’s independence had been guaranteed by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 and its status as a protectorate of the Ottoman Empire since the 16th century. During the 1820s, the Sultanate of Aceh became a regional political and commercial power, supplying half of the world’s pepper, which increased the revenues and influence of local feudal rajahs. Following the opening of the Suez Canal, the trade routes shifted and we are now in a position to strike a deal with the civilized protectors of the Aceh: allow us a free hand within their sphere of influence in Maritime Southeast Asia while we also take the responsibility to fight piracy in the region. With this deal we might get their sanction to conquer Aceh, though we should be ready to give something in return, most probably a colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_case_of_edgardo_mortara_desc;Edgardo Mortara was born to Jewish parents in Bologna in 1851. During a period of illness in 1857, a Catholic servant girl of the Mortara family baptized Edgardo, for fear that he might otherwise, as a non-Christian, go to Hell if he died. On the basis of this baptism, the Papal States’ police took Edgardo away from his family, and had him raised as a Roman Catholic, as non-Christians were, according to Papal States’ law, forbidden to raise Christian children, even their own. The case, or kidnapping, caused an international uproar, and was protested by, among others, Napoleon III, Emperor Franz Josef and The London Times. Mortara himself would go on to become a Catholic priest, and resumed contact with his siblings and mother in his later life.;Edgardo Mortara est né de parents juifs à Bologne en 1851. En 1857, alors qu'il était malade, une servante catholique de la famille Mortara fit baptiser Edgardo de peur qu'il meure et aille en enfer parce qu'il n'était pas chrétien. Sous prétexte qu'il était baptisé, la police pontificale enleva Edgardo à sa famille et le fit élever comme un catholique, car l'Église interdisait aux non chrétiens d'élever des enfants chrétiens, même les leurs. L'affaire, ou l'enlèvement, devint un scandale international et fit l'objet de protestations de Napoléon III, de l'empereur François-Joseph et du London Times. Mortara fut plus tard ordonné prêtre catholique et ne reprit contact avec ses frères et sœurs qu'à la fin de sa vie.;Edgardo Mortara wurde als Sohn jüdischer Eltern 1851 in Bologna geboren. Als er 1857 erkrankte, wurde er von einem katholischen Dienstmädchen der Mortata-Familie auf den Namen Edgardo getauft, da er als Nichtchrist fürchtete, im Falle seines Todes in die Hölle zu müssen. Aufgrund dieser Taufe wurde Edgardo von der Polizei des Kirchenstaats aus seiner Familie entfernt. Daraufhin wurde er römisch-katholisch erzogen, da es Nichtchristen gemäß den Gesetzen des Kirchenstaats verboten war, eigene Kinder aufzuziehen. Dieser Fall bzw. die Entführung führte zu internationalen Protesten, unter anderem von Napoleon III., Kaiser Franz Josef und der London Times. Mortara selbst wurde katholischer Priester und nahm später in seinem Leben wieder Kontakt mit seinen Geschwistern und seiner Mutter auf.;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_ever_victorious_army_desc;The Ever-Victorious Army consisted of Chinese soldiers trained and led by an American and European officer corps. Though the Army was only active for a few years, from 1860 to 1864, it was instrumental in putting down the Taiping Rebellion. It was the first Chinese army which was trained in European techniques, tactics, and strategy. As such, it became a model for later Chinese armies. \n\n The Ever-Victorious Army numbered around 5,000 soldiers at its height. It often defeated rebel forces which were numerically much larger because it was better armed, better commanded, and better trained. It was the first Chinese army to incorporate western style training and tactics, modern weaponry, and most important, the concept of light fast moving infantry units which could move faster than their opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_first_vatican_council_desc;In 1868, Pope Pius IX convened the 20th ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic Church. The council was convened to address the perceived problems of the modern ideologies of liberalism, rationalism and materialism, as well as to further define Catholic dogma. While the council was cut short by the capture of Rome by the newly formed Kingdom of Italy, it still left a lasting impression on Catholic theology in the form of the formalized Dogma of Papal Infallibility.;En 1868, le pape Pie IX convoqua le premier concile œcuménique du Vatican afin de réfléchir aux problèmes posés par les idéologies modernes que sont le libéralisme, le rationalisme et le matérialisme, ainsi que pour redéfinir le dogme catholique.

Now that we are forging an empire of our own, none may deny that we inherit these claims from the Spanish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_rhine_crisis_desc;During Napoleon’s redrawing of the European map, the left bank of the river Rhine had been annexed to France proper. In 1840 France’s Prime Minister Adolphe Thiers publicly stated that, in his opinion, the Rhine still remained France’s natural eastern border. With the hardships of the Napoleonic wars still in living memory the statement caused uproar in Germany, sparking what would become known as ‘The Rhine Crisis’;Lorsque Napoléon redessina la carte de l 'Europe, la rive gauche du Rhin fut annexée par la France. En 1840, le Premier ministre Adolphe Thiers affirma publiquement, qu’à son avis, le Rhin demeurait la frontière orientale naturelle de la France. Le souvenir des temps difficiles des guerres napoléoniennes encore présent dans les mémoire fit que cette déclaration leva un tollé de protestations en Allemagne, donnant naissance à ce qui serait connu sous le nom de «Crise du Rhin».;Im Zuge der Neugestaltung der europäischen Karte durch Napoleon war das linke Rheinufer von Frankreich annektiert worden. Im Jahr 1840 gab Adolphe Thiers, der französische Premierminister, bekannt, dass der Rhein seiner Meinung nach immer noch Frankreichs natürliche Ostgrenze darstelle. Diese Aussage führte in Deutschland vor dem Hintergrund der Schrecken der napoleonischen Kriege zu einem Aufschrei und führte schließlich zur sogenannten 'Rheinkrise'.;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_short_declaration_desc;The Short Declaration was short and brief because it contrasted with the ‘long’ contracts that were earlier concluded between the Netherlands Indies government and some seventeen so-called self-governing lands. The latter were left under the charge of rulers who were empowered to deal with legislative and administrative matters pertaining to their territories, but they had to ensure that obligations to the Netherlands Indies government were met.

the_xiang_army_desc;The Xiang Army was a standing army organized by Zeng Guofan from existing regional and village militia forces called tuanlian to contain the Taiping rebellion. The Army was financed through local nobles and gentry, as opposed to the centralized Manchu-led Qing dynasty. \n\nAlthough it was raised specifically to address problems in Hunan, the Army formed the core of the new Qing military establishment, and as such, forever weakened the Manchu influence within the military. This devolution of centralized command is commonly pointed to as a major reason for the eventual downfall of the Qing and the emergence of regional warlord-ism in China during the first half of the twentieth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

thesaphiban_reforms_desc;Before the thesaphiban reforms, Siam consisted of partially independent cities called mueang, some directly subordinate to the capital, some subordinate to larger mueang, or to one or more of the tributary kingdoms. Before the reforms, governors inherited their posts from their family lineage, and lived on taxes they collected in their area, a practice formally called tax farming. These were converted from hereditary governors to appointed governmental posts, as had been done by Chinese Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era rulers in first recognizing Tusi (tribal leaders) as imperial officials, then replacing them with imperial appointees. The arrangement resulted in governors being appointed and paid by the central government, and mueang developed into provinces. \n\nResistance to these reforms would cause uprisings by traditional local leaders around the Kingdom for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Currently the floods and famines that have taken its toll on the lands has hit them quite hard, with increased taxes current aristocrats and officials have put in place has brought the peasant classes to the point of revolution. In response to this, the government has instituted a number of social, economic and military reforms in order to placate the peasantry. The gwageo system was abolished and replaced by a Japanese bureaucratic system. The administration of financial affairs were centralized, the taxation system redressed, a new monetary system allowed the use of Japanese currency, and the measurement system was changed to that of Japan’s. Other social reforms were addressed as well: discrimination based on the class system, slavery, underage marriage were all banned and widows were granted the right to remarry.

torching_of_the_summer_palace_desc;The Old Summer Palace, known in Chinese as the Gardens of Perfect Brightness, was a complex of gardens northwest of the Imperial City in Beijing, China. The gardens were built in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and functioned as a place of residence for the Qing Emperors. The Old Summer Palace was burnt to the ground by Anglo-French forces during their occupation of Beijing during the Second Opium War. While the torching was a major blow to Chinese morale, it was also decried by many European intellectuals, Victor Hugo among others, as a criminal act of brutality directed against the Chinese. By burning this exquisite piece of Chinese cultural history, we can inflict a massive blow on Chinese morale.;L'ancien Palais d'été, connu en chinois sous le nom des Jardin de l'intelligence parfaite, abritait un vaste parc situé au nord-est de la Cité impériale de Pékin, en Chine.

L'ancien Palais d'été a été brûlé par des troupes anglo-françaises lors de l'occupation de Pékin de la seconde guerre de l'opium. Bien qu'un tel agissement porta un coup sérieux au moral des Chinois, il fut décrié par bon nombre d'intellectuels européens, tels que Victor Hugo, comme un acte criminel dirigé contre les Chinois. En brûlant ce chef-d'œuvre de l'histoire culturelle chinoise, nous porterons un coup sérieux au moral des Chinois.;Der alte Sommerpalast, auf Chinesisch als Garten der Vollkommenheit und des Lichts bekannt, war ein Gartenkomplex nordwestlich der Kaiserstadt in Beijing, China.

Während dies ein starker Schlag für die Moral der Chinesen war, wurde die Brandstiftung auch von vielen europäischen Intellektuellen, unter ihnen Victor Hugo, als krimineller Akt der Brutalität gegen das chinesische Volk verurteilt.

turkish_tea_desc;Turkish tea, called çay, is an important part of Turkish culture. Offering tea to guests is part of Turkish hospitality though tea is most often consumed in households, shops and mostly kiraathane, which is social congregation of Turkish men. Turkish tea is typically prepared using two stacked kettles called ‘çaydanlik’ specially designed for tea preparation. Water is brought to a boil in the larger lower kettle and then some of the water is used to fill the smaller kettle on top and steep (infuse) several spoons of loose tea leaves, producing a very strong tea. Despite the growing popularity of tea in $COUNTRY$, there are no tea producing provinces in our homeland. Now the microclimate region along the eastern coast of the Black Sea was identified by specialists as an ideal spot to start tea production, which will contribute to the task of fulfilling the growing demand for tea by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. However, this knowledge is kept largely a secret by the British and they are bound to be dissatisfied if we start our own tea production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

von_moltkes_staff_reforms_desc;In 1857 Helmuth von Moltke was appointed Chief of the Prussian General Staff, which he soon set about reforming. Among the ideas implemented by von Moltke were a department for historical studies, extensive wargaming exercises and a special department dedicated to cataloguing and studying the telegraph and railway networks of Prussia, and how they could be used to best effect in the event of war. The end result was that, by the time of the Franco-Prussian war, Prussia’s General Staff was considered the most efficient in Europe, it’s methods soon becoming widely studied and adopted abroad. Moltke remained Chief of the Prussian Staff for the next 30 years, and is known as one of the most brilliant military strategists of the 19th century.;En 1857, Helmut von Moltke fut nommé Chef de l’état-major de la Prusse, qu’il entreprit bientôt de réformer. Parmi les idées mises en œuvre par von Moltke, un service d’études historiques, une utilisation intensive du wargame ou kreigspiel et un service spécial dédié à la cartographie complète des réseaux de télégraphe et de chemin de fer de Prusse et leur utilisation en cas de guerre. Le résultat fut que lors de la guerre de 1870, l’état-major prussien étai de loin le plus efficace d’Europe et ses méthodes commencèrent à être étudiées et copiées à l’étranger. Moltke resta Chef d’état-major de la Prusse pendant 30 ans et demeure l’un des plus brillants stratèges militaires du XIXe siècle.;Im Jahr 1857 wurde Helmuth von Moltke zum Chef des preußischen Generalstabs ernannt, den er schon kurz darauf reformierte. Zu seinen Ideen gehörte auch eine Abteilung für historische Studien, extensive Truppenmanöver und eine Spezialabteilung zum Katalogisieren und Studium der Telegraphen- und Eisenbahnnetzwerke Preußens, und wie sie im Kriegsfall am effizientesten genutzt werden könnten. Aufgrund dieser Anstrengungen galt der preußische Generalstab zur Zeit des französisch-preußischen Krieges als der effizienteste in ganz Europa, dessen Methoden man im Ausland schon bald eingehend studierte und nachahmte.

rus_californian_question_desc;For a long time, Russian officials of RAK have yearned to establish Russian settlements in California. First Rezanov, then Baranov, under whose instructions Kuskov undertook several expeditions in order to chart the coast of California and to find a good place for the new settlement. He found it in 1812, in the Gulf of Rumyantsev. Kuskovs party determined that this spot just a short distance to the north would be perfect for the first Russian colony in California. Fort Ross was born, and so did the ideas of expansion in the region. In 1824, Dmitry Zavalishin proposed an extensive Russian colonization plan of California, which would see large numbers of freed Russian serfs being transported to the territory. Zavalishin wanted to extend Russian control over all of Northern California at least to the Sacramento River, if not beyond. While it was debated heavily, the Russian foreign minister Karl Nesselrode argued against it, which convinced the Russian Tsar not to back it. In another plan, retired admiral Nikolay Mordvinov wrote to Nesselrode suggesting that the Russians expand their area of control around the Fort Ross colony in all directions, all the way to the Rocky Mountains if possible. In 1825, the Russian-American Company even suggested taking away San Francisco from the Mexicans. However, none of these plans found serious support in the upper echelons of the government. Now, some years later, the elderly retired Admiral Mordvinov, still going strong in his late 80s, has come before the Emperor to raise the idea one more time. The Mexicans are weak, the Anglos are busy. Perhaps now is the time to strike?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

courland_gambia_desc;Jacob Kettler, Duke of Courland from 1642 to 1682, engaged in several attempts at colonization, one of which was the land around the province of Banjul in the Gambia. The fledgling colony had many troubles until it was stolen by the Dutch and subsequently by the British, the French, Swedish and many others until it came back to British hands. As our standing and influences in the international community grows, we can now demand the masters of the Gambia to hand over their Gambian colony on the basis of the first ownership act. Our control of Courland-Semigallia allows us to lay claims on it. And if they do not hand it back, we would have a very valid casus belli against them. Alternatively, we could make them a nice offer of 250,000?for the whole colony and obtain it peacefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Indeed ripping it off the hands of the British will be difficult, but we could obtain it by making a high enough offer... If not, we have a valid casus belli to make it ours once more. The story of Colony of New Courland is a sad one, but by placing it within our grasp once again we could amend the hardships the colonists suffered way back then. Though its climate might not be the best, as the island is located within the Atlantic Hurricane Belt, locals and botanists alike describe it as a "Tropical Paradise" when it's not being ravaged by storms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Germans were also exempt from paying taxes. This enabled the creation of one of Europe's greatest textile centers in ód and adjacent towns such as Ozorków and Zduska Wola. These small and inconsequential towns grew into enormous and multicultural cities, with Germans and Jews constituting the majority of the population. With the removal of border tariffs in 1851 and subsequent economic growth, Polish cities grew in richness and importance.

manchurian_ultimatum_title;Seize Manchuria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
manchurian_ultimatum_desc;The significance of the Manchurian railway system cannot be overstated. It cut our journey to Vladivostok in half and connected us to Port Arthur, our lone warm port in this section of the Pacific. Our army has been stationed in Manchuria since the construction of the railway, and while we promised to depart after the Boxer Rebellion, we never did so. Many within our government want to grab complete control of Manchuria and annex it to our Empire. In the East, nascent power of Japan has been emerging in Korea, and our interests in Korea, Manchuria, and China have begun to clash. They will undoubtedly be interested in whatever we undertake in regards China. So far, our policy was to continue the status quo and use the weak Qing government to prop it up against Japan, while Qing does our bidding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

abolish_redemption_payments_title;Abolish Redemption Payments;;;;;;;;;x
abolish_redemption_payments_desc;When the last vestiges of serfdom have been abolished in middle 19th century Europe, in some countries, aristocrats were compensated by government bonds or cash, while former serfs were burdened with debt towards the government, to pay off the land they now own. Rates were usually steep, and many former serfs could not do survive of the small land they now have and pay back this debt. In Romania, for instance, they were instructed to pay these Redemptions for 15 years. In Saxony, it was ten. In Russia, fourthy-nine years. In Austria, in places like Hungary and Bukovina, government paid off the aristocracy, while in others serfs were expected to pay it themselves. This burned on our population is quite hated amongst the former serfs, and creates a great deal of unrest. If we are to abolish it before time, it will help our people a great deal. However, the money that flows in to the treasury from this is quite a hefty one, so we must weigh our options carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

latin_monetary_union_FRA_desc;In 1865, the Latin Monetary Union was formed by France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy. Greece joined in 1868. The Union standardized the size, weight, denomination, and silver and gold content of the coins of member countries and it also favoured free trade. From then on, the currency of a member country was also valid in another member country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

embrace_pan_latinism_desc;While France is certainly more united compared to its German neighbours, the fact remains that large amounts of Latin and Romance-cultured people reside outside of France’s influence and borders. Iberians and Italians have been both residing in poverty, disunited and divided, and under British and Austrian yokes. Over the seas, the nascent Latin American Republics are struggling. If we were to encourage Latin pan-nationalism, both here and abroad, we may be able to one day unite Latin peoples of the world under a single Latin flag. In 1860s, Emperor Napoleon embraced and adopted the idea of Pan-Latinism that stems from writers such as Chevalier, Stendhal, Dante, and others. It was the primary justification of Emperor's intervention in Mexico, claiming to protect cultural unity of Latin peoples and presented France as the modern leader of the Latin world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

proclaim_latin_union_desc;We have thrown Austrians out of the Apennine - we have thrown the poisonous Anglo influence from Iberia - We have beaten back Germans on the Rhine. The First French Empire's primary base of power stemmed from France, but also Iberia and Italy. In 1800s, we brought them the Napoleonic Code and civil rights when it was untimely ripped away from them by British and the Germans. This time it will be different. We have the Emperor of the French again, but why should he not be Emperor of the Latins? Destiny is Now. We will proclaim the Latin Union. Road ahead of us will not be easy, but damn be the opinions and reactions of stale courts of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

reintroduce_napoleonic_code_desc;Currently our territories are governed by different civil law systems, varying from region to region. Decrepit remnants of Absolutism in Italy, countless regional differences of Spain, make it very hard for our citizens to be truly united, or governed, as one country. Once, these lands were graced with Napolenic Code in 1804, but were taken from the people by the reactionary aristocracy of Europe in 1815. We shall reintroduce the Napoleonic Code to these territories once again, synchronizing various regions into one legal system and we will throw out outdated and redundant laws and procedures. Aside from the Civil Code which covers leading civil law institutions and articles pertaining to "persons, property and acquisition of property", we shall also synchronize the criminal legal systems and introduce the Penal Code of 1810.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

question_of_administration_desc;While we are introducing Napoleonic Civil and Penal Codes across the Latin Union, the question of local administration arises. At the moment, different administrative systems exist, which makes it all harder to govern. If we are to truly unite as a country, we must synchronize our administration.

question_of_administration2_desc;The territorial reorganisation by department levels is going smoothly, but the question of vastness of our lands, as well as regional and cultural differences remains. If we are to unify as a people, not everything has to be decided in the capital. Such a big country cannot follow a Unitary government, it is too unwieldy, ineffective. If we are to function normally, we must adopt a federal system of departments that allows for both federal representation and local autonomy in the regions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Nonetheless, we shall gather the best of our linguistic minds in the entire country to find the most optimal solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_pacific_reclamation_spa_desc;The claims of the Viceroyalty of New Spain extended all the way to the 61st parallel and included much of the lands later taken by the British, Russians and Americans. These claims were only given up by Spain in 1819 with the Treaty of Adams-Onís. Mexico was only party to this treaty in 1828 under duress from the United States. When they recognized the independence of the Tejano rebels in 1836, they broke this treaty, and as such we are in no obligation to follow it either. It is time to repudiate this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

plombieres2_desc;The French Emperor Napoleon III is keen to settle the ‘Italian question’ and to correct the humiliations of the 1815 Vienna Congress. He had long ago formed the view that this required a war against Austria, in his view, war with Austria could bring France military success, delivering glory to France and humiliation to Austria. \n\nThe prime-minister of Piedmont, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, aware of the French objectives believes there is an opportunity to serve these, while at the same time fulfilling his own by removing the burdensome yoke of Austrian repression from as many Italian citizens as possible. \n\nWe should propose a meeting with the French Emperor as soon as the opportunity arises;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

greater_austrian_destiny_desc;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who say Austria’s unquestioned dominance obligates it to unite Greater Germany under a single flag. Still others say that, no, Austria already has its own name and empire, one that stretches over many cultures who would never welcome becoming more dominated by the Germans… not to mention that a Greater Germany would alarm the powers of Europe to such a degree it would almost surely herald a war. Thus the question arises: what shall our path be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
