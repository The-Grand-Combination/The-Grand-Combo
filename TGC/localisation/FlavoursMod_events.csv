During the late 19th century, Britain's primary goal in foreign policy was to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to intervene if that balance was upset. Its secondary goal was to protect its overseas interest in the colonies and dominions, as free trade kept the Empire alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC372380;As a result of what the French considered an insult to the French consul in Algiers by the Dey in 1827, France blockaded Algiers for three years. In 1830, France invaded and occupied the coastal areas of Algeria, citing a diplomatic incident as casus belli. Hussein Dey, the last Ottoman regent of Algiers, went into exile. \n Soon after the conquest of Algiers, the soldier-politician Bertrand Clauzel and others formed a company to acquire agricultural land and, despite official discouragement, to subsidize its settlement by European farmers, triggering a land rush. Clauzel recognized the farming potential of the Mitidja Plain and envisioned the production there of cotton on a large scale. Consequently, French colonisation penetrated southwards in Algeria with skirmishes erupting between Europeans and the native population. Emir Abdelkader El Djezairi fled south, regrouping and organizing a new resistance against the Europeans advance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC372381;As a result of what the French considered an insult to the French consul in Algiers by the Dey in 1827, France blockaded Algiers for three years. In 1830, France invaded and occupied the coastal areas of Algeria, citing a diplomatic incident as casus belli. Hussein Dey, the last Ottoman regent of Algiers, went into exile. \nArab tribal elders in the territories near Mascara chose Abdelkader, who was recognized as Amir al-Muminin (commander of the faithful), to lead the jihad against the French. After a series of heavy losses and military reversals in Algeria, there have been talks of a negotiated peace with Abdelkader, in which Abdelkader would officially recognize French imperial sovereignty in Africa. However, the price for such recognition would be the secession of approximately two thirds of Algeria to Abdelkader, leaving us with a few coastal ports.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC372382;Appointed Bey of Constantine in 1826, Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Sherif, also known as Ahmed Bey led the Algerian resistance against the French occupation forces in the eastern Algeria with the aid of Hussein Pasha. After the capture of Algiers, he retired in his province to Constantine, where he and his community considered themselves in a holy war (Jihad) against the French.\n\nIn $YEAR$, Marshal Clauzel, the governor general of Algeria laid out a complete plan of conquest to the French government to capture all strategic positions of the eastern Algerian interior. This plan would severely weaken the Emir of Mascara and the Bey of Constantine and stabilise and secure the French position in Algeria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC372384;In $YEAR$, the passage of a French column led by Governor-General Vallée and the Duc d’Orléans from Algiers to Constantine through the mountain pass known as the 'Iron Gates', territory which Emir Abdelkader considered his by the terms of the Treaty of Tafna. Abdelkader reacted to this provocative act by informing the French military authorities that he viewed it as an act of war and would respond accordingly. \n\nHe followed this declaration, which local military authorities failed to take seriously, with a spectacular raid on the Mitia Plain outside Algiers, the heart of the nascent colony of l’Algérie française. His nizam-i cedid corps and tribal cavalry swept across the plain killing European colonists, burning their farms and stealing their cattle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC372383;Until the beginning of $YEAR$ the struggle went in Abdelkader's favour. However, resistance was put down by Marshal Bugeaud, due to Bugeaud's adaptation to the guerilla tactics employed by Abdelkader. Abdelkader would strike fast and disappear into the terrain with light infantry, however French forces increased their mobility and brutally suppressed the native population and practiced a scorched earth policy in the countryside to force the residents to starve so as to desert their leader. \nAbdelkader ultimately was forced to surrender to General Louis de Lamoricière in exchange for the promise that he would be allowed to go to Alexandria or Acre. He supposedly commented on his own surrender with the words, "And God undoes what my hand has done". His request was granted, and two days later his surrender was made official to the French Governor-General of Algeria, Henri d'Orléans, duc d'Aumale, to whom Abdelkader symbolically handed his war-horse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
