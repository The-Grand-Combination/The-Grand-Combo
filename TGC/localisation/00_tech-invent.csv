adam_smith;Adam Smith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adam_smith_desc;Adam Smith was a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher of political economy. He was author of The Theory of Moral Sentiments and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Smith promoted the central tenement of Capitalism as the individual pursuing his own self-interest, and in so doing, promoting the greater good. He talked about the ‘invisible hand’ that would guide the actions of individuals and argued against government interference in all but a few aspects of the economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adolph_wagner;Adolph Wagner;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adolph_wagner_desc;Although one of the more active members of Schmoller’s Verein, Wagner actually supported Menger in the Methodenstreit. His work on public finance is what he is best known for in economics. Outside economics, he was a companion of Lassalle and Rodbertus—although not sharing wholly in their socialist ideals and of more conservative instincts in political matters, Wagner was a severe critic of unfettered capitalism and recommended state alleviation of the burden upon labour. He wrote ‘Science of Finance Vol 1–4’ (1877–1901), and ‘Foundations of Political Economy’ (1876).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_battleships;Advanced Battleships;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_battleships_desc;The experiences of the First World War lead to a series of design improvements for battleships, including a more effective use of armour protection to defend against plunging fire, improved protection against torpedoes, the widespread use of oil-driven propulsion, and further refinements in armament and fire control. Though few battleships were constructed in the first years after the First World War, due to economic constraints and treaty limitations, existing battleships were refitted to incorporate these advances in design.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_cruisers;Advanced Cruisers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_cruisers_desc;By the early 1920s cruiser design focussed on two main types: light cruisers, generally with 6-inch main armament, and heavy cruisers, generally with 8-inch main armament.

alexander_bain;Alexander Bain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alexander_bain_desc;An associate of J.S. Mill, Alexander Bain added connections from physiology to associationist psychology, adding the laws of compound and constructive association to those of contiguity, similarity, and frequency. He was known for writing two of the earliest textbooks in psychology in 1855 and 1859, which were used by later experimental psychologists such as William James. His Spencer–Bain principle concerning probability of behaviour recalls the later Behaviourist school in its conclusions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alfred_adler;Alfred Adler;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alfred_adler_desc;Alfred Adler was an Austrian doctor and psychotherapist. Adler diverged from Freud in arguing that unconscious motivation could be better explained by teleological goals rather than instinctual drives. According to Adler, people are born with a feeling of Inferiority. People attempt to overcome these feelings of inferiority. Adler posited one of three outcomes. An ‘inferiority complex’ develops in people who are overwhelmed by these feelings. Some of these will develop a superiority complex to mask their true feelings. Psychologically healthy people manifest the concept of self-esteem and satisfy their goals through a sense of personal achievement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alfred_binet;Alfred Binet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alfred_binet_desc;Alfred Binet was a French psychologist who pioneered the use of standardized testing to measure individual differences in intelligence. The French government commissioned Binet and his student Theodore Simon to develop a test in 1899 to differentiate ‘retarded’ from ‘normal’ children. The Simon-Binet test divided intelligence into several areas and measured each with a battery of questions. Questions considered to measure higher ability were those answered more often by students whom their teachers had rated highly. Binet also believed that intelligences were inherited, but improvable by education. His test assigned a single ‘mental-level’ score to each subject based on their test results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ammunition_production;Ammunition Production;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ammunition_production_desc;The design and production of basic munitions saw much improvement over the course of the 19th century. Advances in weapons design—from muzzle to breech loads to semi-automatics and machine guns—naturally meant that the design and production of ammunition also had to follow suit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amphibious_warfare_training;Amphibious Warfare Training;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amphibious_warfare_training_desc;The experiences of the First World War had demonstrated not only the potential of large-scale amphibious warfare, but also the limitations of current practices and equipment. As such, in the interwar period the major powers worked to increase their capability to launch effective amphibious assaults. These efforts included not only the development of needed equipment, such as purpose-built landing craft, but also the creation and training of land units specializing in amphibious assaults, and the creation of specific naval strategies and tactics to best utilize warships in support and defence of amphibious operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Freud became known for her work on the social importance of the ego in childhood development. She wrote ‘The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence’ in which she further developed the concept of defence mechanisms such as repression, displacement, reaction formation and rationalization. These are mental processes to reduce consciousness of wishes, memories and thoughts that prove threatening to self-esteem and security of the individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

antitoxins;Antitoxins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
antitoxins_desc;An Antitoxin is an antibody with the ability to neutralize a specific toxin. Antitoxins are produced by certain animals, plants, and bacteria. Although they are most effective in neutralizing toxins, they can kill bacteria and other microorganisms. Antitoxins are made within organisms, but can be injected into other organisms, including humans. This procedure involves injecting an animal with a safe amount of a particular toxin. Then, the animal’s body makes the antitoxin needed to neutralize the toxin. Later, the blood is withdrawn from the animal. When the antitoxin is obtained from the blood, it is purified and injected into a human or other animal, inducing passive immunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

autarky;Autarky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
autarky_desc;Derived from the Ancient Greek for self-sufficiency, in the early twentieth century autarky was the goal for many States that felt further dependence upon the global economy was a threat to their national independence or the ideological basis of their regimes. In order to achieve autarky, such states would impose huge tariff barriers to imports from overseas, encourage the development of local industries to produce goods previously imported, strictly regulate foreign trade to preserve national income, and investigate the development of alternative substitutes to critical raw materials that were not available to the nation except from the world market. As an economic policy autarky could be called a twentieth-century revision of mercantilism, and while most often used by Communist and Fascist regimes that rejected all or part the capitalist model of economic production, even capitalist nations would resort to elements of autarky in times of economic instability, especially if they controlled large overseas empires that could provide key raw materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They began to set their own sets of regulations and hire their own staff. In other countries, however, civil servants were chosen among political supporters and allies. By use of patronage the administration was thus kept into line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buying_on_margin;Buying On Margin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buying_on_margin_desc;As more individuals became involved in investing in securities markets in the early twentieth century, the practice of buying on margin developed to increase the number of shares that could be bought with minimal initial overhead. The principal of buying on margin is that if the investment makes a profit, the profit will cover the cost of the commission charged for allowing the purchase of large amounts of securities with only a minimal initial investment. The risk involved in this type of investment is that if the investment shows a loss, the difference between the initial investment and the commission charged for the purchase must be made up by the investor. How low an initial margin was prudent for the securities industry to accept would be the subject of intense debate, as lower margins both allowed investors with limited capital to invest in markets, but raised the risk of default by these limited-capital investors should the investments fail to produce profits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

canning_process;Canning Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
canning_process_desc;The canning process was invented after prolonged research by Nicolas Appert of France in 1809, in response to a call by his government for a means of preserving food for army and navy use. Appert’s method consisted of tightly sealing food inside a bottle or jar, heating it to a certain temperature, and maintaining the heat for a certain period, after which the container was kept sealed until use. In 1810 Peter Durand of England patented the use of tin-coated iron cans instead of bottles, and by 1820 he was supplying canned food to the Royal Navy in large quantities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After he left in 1899, he took an entry level job at BASF, then Germany’s largest chemical and dye firm. From 1909 until 1913 he transformed Fritz Haber’s tabletop demonstration of a method to fix nitrogen using high pressure chemistry into an important industrial process to produce megatons of fertilizer and explosives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carl_menger;Carl Menger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carl_menger_desc;Carl Menger has been hailed as one of the three leaders of the ‘Marginalist Revolution’ of the 1870s, along with William Stanley Jevons and Léon Walras. However, Menger’s ‘Grundsätze’ (‘Principles’), published in 1871, eschewed all the mathematical scaffolding that characterized the works of the other two revolutionaries. As such, many economists have insisted that Menger should be placed apart. In one sense, he can be considered different. Unlike Jevons or Walras, Carl Menger founded a proper ‘school of thought’ which has more-or-less retained its distinctive character since—namely, the Austrian School. His two disciples at Vienna, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Friedrich von Wieser did much to advance and forge that school.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carlism;Carlism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carlism_desc;Carlism is a traditionalist and legitimist political movement in Spain seeking the establishment of a separate line of the Bourbon family on the Spanish throne.

centralized_economic_planning;Centralized Economic Planning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralized_economic_planning_desc;As more radical ideological alternatives to liberal democracy gained power in the early twentieth century, the opportunity to reconstruct economic organization based on State direction of economic activity that could be compared to the relative success or failure of traditional market-based economic structures arose. Such programs of centralized economic planning, employed by both communist and fascist regimes, often achieved dramatic initial results in reducing unemployment, increasing output of industrial goods, and removing the problem of conflict between labourer and employer in society, which the regimes would trumpet as proof of the superiority of their systems over free market systems. The social and economic costs to these societies, however, were often very high, and the resistance to State control created the potential for brutal repression. However, to the outside world that new little of the negative consequences of these plans, they seemed to suggest a viable alternative to the free-market systems that had been the hallmark of nineteenth century economic theory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
charles_spearman;Charles Spearman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
charles_spearman_desc;Charles Spearman was a British psychologist and mathematician. Spearman criticized Galton’s tests as being too simple to measure intelligence. He preferred Binet’s test but criticized the use of a universal number to characterize different areas of intelligence. He developed the process of factor analysis, measuring correlations between performance in different test areas. He proposed two underlying factors ‘g’ for general intelligence to explain the correlations and ‘s’ for specific abilities to explain the imperfections in his correlations. His ‘g’ factor was not a concrete number, but he too believed in the heritability of intelligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

color_motion_picture;Colour Motion Pictures;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
color_motion_picture_desc;After the advent of motion pictures, a tremendous amount of energy was invested in the production of photography in natural colour. Early movies were not actually colour movies, since they were shot monochrome and hand-coloured or machine-coloured afterwards. In 1902, Edward Raymond Turner produced first films with natural colour process rather than using colorization techniques. In 1908, Kinemacolor was introduced. In the same year, A Visit to the Seaside, a short film became the first natural colour movie to be publicly presented. In 1917 Technicolor was introduced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

With the use of a steam engine in a combine harvester, the potential harvest of a single worker increases dramatically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
combined_arms_planning;Combined Arms Planning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
combined_arms_planning_desc;In the aftermath of the First World War, the major powers put an increasing emphasis on what came to be known as combined operations. This represented the utilization of land, sea, and air forces together to achieve a single strategic objective. Often revolving around amphibious operations, combined operations often fit within larger naval strategic objectives, including the destruction of enemy naval assets and the securing of sea-lanes. No longer could navies operate in isolation from the other branches of the military, and the development of new tactics was required to integrate naval warfare into the larger strategic perspective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cotton_gin_desc;The Cotton Gin is a machine for cleaning cotton of its seeds. The device pulls the cotton through a set of wire teeth mounted on a revolving cylinder, the fibre passing through narrow slots in an iron breastwork too small to permit passage of the seed. The simplicity of the invention—which could be powered by man, animal, or water—caused it to be widely copied despite patents. The cotton gin increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50. While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fibre from the seeds, a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Organized study of human antiquity dates back to the days of the Renaissance, but in the 19th century archaeology evolved into a true science. Archaeologists began to investigate various ruins around the world, with the study of ancient Aegean civilization being stimulated by the excavations of Heinrich Schliemann at Troy and of Arthur Evans at Crete, while John Lloyd Stephens was a pivotal figure in the rediscovery of the Maya civilization throughout Central America. However, the methodologies employed by these early archaeologists were problematic by the standards of the 20th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He showed that a rat could run the maze on the first try, if it was previously allowed to explore the maze while not hungry. Tolman evinced that the subject learned useful stimulus information about the world without reference to a reinforcing stimulus. The ability to run the maze correctly on trial one demonstrated flexibility in the use of the learned information. Tolman’s stimulus–stimulus learning was opposed by the stimulus–response orthodoxy of Skinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

eduard_bernstein_desc;Eduard Bernstein was originally a staunch disciple of Marx and started his life in the German Social-democratic Party, but during his later exile in London Bernstein gradually became convinced that the best way to obtain socialism in an industrialized country was through trade union activity and parliamentary politics. He published a series of articles where he argued that the predictions made by Karl Marx about the development of capitalism had not come true. He pointed out that the real wages of workers had risen and the polarization of classes between an oppressed proletariat and capitalist, had not materialized. Nor had capital become concentrated in fewer hands. Bernstein’s revisionist views appeared in his extremely influential book ‘Evolutionary Socialism’ (1899).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

el_thorndike_desc;Edward Lee Thorndike was an American researcher who also conducted experiments in animal learning. He was known for his puzzle-box procedure, in which a hungry cat was placed inside a small cage and observed to see how long it took the cat to learn to pull the lever and escape, where food was waiting. He observed that after 20-30 trials, the cats had become efficient at escaping almost instantaneously. Thorndike formulated the law of effect, stating that responses producing a positive effect became more likely to occur again, and those producing discomfort were less likely to occur again. These observations were later transformed by B.F. Skinner into the concept of operant conditioning in psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

enemy_plotting_cards_desc;These cards held the full performance and picture of each enemy ship class. This made it easier to know what one was fighting, what its maximum speed was, its main armament etc. This made it much easier to make decisions both on the bridge and out on the combat stations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
establishment;Establishment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
establishment_desc;The Establishment is a term used to refer to a visible dominant group or elite which holds power or authority in a nation. The term suggests a closed social group which selects its own members (as opposed to selection by inheritance, merit or election).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
eugen_von_bohm_bawerk;Eugen Böhm von Bawerk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
eugen_von_bohm_bawerk_desc;Böhm-Bawerk’s career as a scholar was an intermittent one. The most significant span of scholarly activity was his years at the University of Innsbruck. It was during the 1880s that he first published two of the three volumes of his magnum opus, ‘Capital and Interest’. His later years were dominated by his duties as the Austrian Minister of Finance, a position he held, though not continuously, throughout the 1890s and beyond—and for which he is fittingly honoured by having his likeness on Austria’s one—hundred schillings note. After serving in this capacity and assuming other governmental duties, he returned to teaching in 1904. With a chair at the University of Vienna, he became a colleague of Wieser, successor to the retired Menger. Students who passed through the university during the last decade of Böhm-Bawerk’s career included Joseph Schumpeter and Ludwig von Mises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
eugenics;Eugenics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
eugenics_desc;An outgrowth from Darwinist ideas on natural selection and trait theories and from the studies in intelligence measurement, Eugenics was concerned with the mental and physical traits found in society and a response to the weaknesses found. Positive eugenics encouraged family programs, social welfare, and the importance of education in the desirability of breeding to increase the appearance of positive traits. Negative eugenics argued for the need to remove weak traits by removing undesirable elements, leading to sterilization and even extermination of target groups.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
existentialism;Existentialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
existentialism_desc;Existentialism has many mothers. In one way it could be interpreted as a radical individualism traced from Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, but it is more. It is also the notion of the given as not really given but only meaningful through the process of interpretation, something that it got from Husserl, and more indirectly from Bretano. However, it was taken further by Heidegger and later Sartre, Beauvoir, and Camus, and became focused on what gives meaning to the person, where the person should be understood as a being that is free to take action and thus create their own meaning rather than the more inflexible, outdated cartesian ideal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
expansionism;Expansionism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
expansionism_desc;An expansionist country seeks to expand its territory, influence, or power over a territory, population, or political entity by any means deemed necessary, ultimately by use of armed force.

expressionist_art_desc;The expressionists rushed to exploit the newly expanded boundaries of expression, and break some of their own. But unlike their predecessors, they did not wish to portray the physical world, but use it as a medium for expressing the emotions, and the soul, within. The most important expressionist group was the German school, which included painters Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Emil Nolde, Max Pechstein, and Otto Müller.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

firepower_vs_mobility;Firepower vs. Mobility;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
firepower_vs_mobility_desc;After the end of the First World War, the major powers had to re-evaluate their military strategies in light of the brutal lessons learned during the years of inconclusive trench warfare. One major school of thought that emerged focussed on the importance of using massed firepower, principally in the form of artillery, to overwhelm the enemy and literally blast a hole in their lines to facilitate an advance, while another school of thought suggested that the key to victory on the modern battlefield was mobility, so that friendly forces could manoeuvre around enemy strongpoints to pursue the attack on more advantageous terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fish_trawlers;Fishing Trawlers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fish_trawlers_desc;The modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of Brixham. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon. The Brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig, which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of ‘Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fleet_in_being_doctrine;Fleet-In-Being Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fleet_in_being_doctrine_desc;The ‘fleet in being’ concept is based on the assumption that the fleet is relatively safe in port, even if near the enemy. Keeping the ‘fleet in being’, one could maintain an active threat which would force the enemy to remain in the area and prevent them from taking the initiative elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
flexible_counterattacks;Flexible Counterattacks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
flexible_counterattacks_desc;After the enemy had gone over the top and his offensive was ebbing this tactic meant pre-planned counterattacks against gaps in the enemy line where advance had not been synchronized. These counterattacks could sometimes push back the enemy even further than is original attacking positions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

flintlock_rifle_armament_desc;Introduced at the beginning of the 17th century, the flintlock rapidly replaced earlier firearm–ignition technologies, such as the doglock, matchlock, and wheellock mechanisms. It continued to be in common use for over two centuries, replaced by percussion cap and, later, cartridge-based systems in the early-to-mid 19th century. Although long superseded by modern firearms, flintlock weapons enjoy continuing popularity with black powder shooting enthusiasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

francis_galton;Francis Galton;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
francis_galton_desc;Sir Francis Galton was a British aristocrat who wrote extensively on the measurement of an individual’s mental abilities using sensory and motor tests. His 1869 work ‘Hereditary Genius: An Inquiry into its Laws and Consequences’ argued that the children of geniuses tended to become geniuses themselves. He surveyed thousands of fellow academics, publishing in 1874 his findings that intelligence was primarily a heritable trait, although there was some necessity for environmental nurturance of that trait. He was the first to use identical and fraternal twins to measure the effects of nature versus nurture, and established in 1888 the theoretical basis for correlation, scatterplots, and regression as measurement tools.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
franz_boas;Franz Boas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
franz_boas_desc;Franz Boas was a German–American anthropologist, a pioneer of modern anthropology who has been called the ‘Father of Modern Anthropology’. He applied the scientific method to the study of human cultures and societies. Previously this discipline was based on the formulation of grand theories around anecdotal knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
freud;Sigmund Freud;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
freud_desc;Sigmund Freud was an Austrian neurologist who founded the disciple of psychoanalysis. He is best known for his theories on the unconscious mind and the mechanism of repression, and for creating the clinical method of psychoanalysis for investigating the mind and treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud established sexual drives as the primary motivational forces of human life, developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association, discovered the phenomenon of transference in the therapeutic relationship and established its central role in the analytic process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friction_hoist;Friction Hoist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friction_hoist_desc;Invented in 1877 by Frederick Koepe, friction (or Koepe) hoists are mounted on the ground above the mine shaft, or at the top of the headframe. They utilize tail ropes and counterweights and do not have the haulage rope fixed to the wheel, but instead passed around it. The tail-ropes and weights offset the need for the motor to overcome the weight of the conveyance and hoisting rope, thereby reducing the required horsepower of the hoisting motor by up to 30%, with the overall power consumption remaining the same. Friction hoists, unlike drum hoists, can and normally do use multiple ropes giving them a larger payload capacity, however since they require a larger safety factor, they are impractical for very deep shafts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friedrich_engels;Friedrich Engels;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friedrich_engels_desc;As a young man Engels went to Manchester to help his father manage his cotton factory. Engels was shocked by the poverty in the city and began writing an account that was published as ‘Condition of the Working Classes in England’ (1844). Here Engels met Marx with whom he would write and try to organize the international worker organizations for the rest of his life. Engels lived in the shadows of Marx’s intellectually, but economically he financed Marx so that he could write. Basically, there wouldn’t have been a Marx without an Engels and vice versa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friedrich_hayek;Friedrich Hayek;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friedrich_hayek_desc;An Austrian economist who would challenge the influence of Keynesian economics upon the actions of the State in the 1930s and attach the planned economic models inherent in both socialist and fascist political models increasingly in vogue in the era. Much like his teacher Ludwig von Mises, Hayek attacked Keynesian economic prescriptions for dealing with economic downturns as causing more potential problems than solutions by creating conditions for inflation by raising demand more rapidly than supply could meet. Hayek rejected the idea of central planning in the marketplace as highly inefficient in its ability to produce the supply and quality of goods that would be generated by consumer demand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friedrich_list;Friedrich List;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friedrich_list_desc;Friedrich List was a nationalist and romantic critic of economic theory and one of the forefathers of the German Historical School. His best-known work, ‘The National System of Political Economy’ (1841) was written as against the free-trade doctrines that permeated Classical economics. However, his was not a polemical defence of protectionism. He argued it on the basis of his analysis of economics, which stressed political factors—notably, the ‘nation’—in economics. List argued that it was the government’s responsibility to foster the ‘productive powers’ of a nation and, once these were in place, then free trade could ensue, but not before. This is akin to the modern ‘infant industry’ argument for protection. More relevantly, he developed a theory of economic ‘stages’ which was to serve as a blueprint for the German Historical School.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
froth_flotation;Froth Flotation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
froth_flotation_desc;Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic. This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historicallyin this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century. It has been described as ‘the single most important operation used for the recovery and upgrading of sulphide ores’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
futurism;Futurism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
futurism_desc;As the questioning of the values and structures of the Victorian era gained momentum in intellectual circles in the early twentieth century, some intellectuals began to argue that a clean break with the past was needed in order to build a brilliant new future that the rise of industrial civilization had promised. Beginning as a movement within the arts that embraced new materials and stylistic techniques that attempted to capture the essence of material power and speed, Futurism would soon spread as an idea to challenge conventional structures of society and call for their replacement with a new social, political and economic order that embraced the reality of industrial society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

gaslights_desc;The introduction of gas lights meant that predefined areas like small rooms or big factory floors could be enlightened. This meant that people were no longer limited by sunrise and sunset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gendarmerie;Gendarmerie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gendarmerie_desc;A gendarmerie is a military component with jurisdiction in civil law enforcement. The term ‘gendarmerie’ is derived from the medieval French expression gens d’armes, which translates to ‘armed people’. Gendarmeries may bear other titles, for instance the Carabinieri in Italy, the Guardia Civil in Spain or the Royal Marechaussee in the Netherlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
genetics_heredity;Genetics: Heredity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
genetics_heredity_desc;Heredity Genetics were a major step towards the understanding of life itself. Gregor Mendel assumed that every trait an organism contains is written down in some material factors and are transferred during the process of reproduction. In experiments with his pea plants he could prove his thesis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
germ_theory;Germ Theory and Experimental Pathology;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
germ_theory_desc;The germ theory of disease states that some diseases are caused by microorganisms. These small organisms, too small to see without magnification, invade humans, animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause a disease. The germ theory was proposed in the mid-16th century and gained widespread credence when substantiated by scientific discoveries of the 17th through the late 19th century. It supplanted earlier explanations for disease, such as Galen’s miasma theory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gold_standard;Gold Standard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gold_standard_desc;This meant a currency system based on gold. Money was rather expensive to produce by the government and this could sometimes result in a low of money stock. However, the good thing was that the gold prices was rather stable and the trust in gold was high and made the currency stable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

grand_battle_plan_vs_superior_firepower_desc;For those armies that focussed on firepower, another crucial decision revolved around how that firepower was to be utilized. One possibility was to craft intricate and detailed plans that integrated artillery strikes on specific targets timed to end just as the main assault was launched, while another possibility was simply to mass together as much artillery as possible and bombard the enemy until he gave way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gs_hall;G. Stanley Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gs_hall_desc;G. Stanley Hall was the first President of the American Psychological Association. Hall founded the American Journal of Psychology in 1887. His research focused on educational psychology and adolescence. He adapted the term ‘Storm and Stress’ to characterize the period of adolescence. Hall believed in the heritability of behaviour and supported the Eugenics program. His views on child development were later largely refuted by Piaget and Vygotsky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

gustav_von_schmoller;Gustav von Schmoller;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gustav_von_schmoller_desc;Schmoller’s opposition to Neoclassical economics entered him into a famous methodological debate (Methodenstreit) with Carl Menger. Although many argue that he lost the debate by the simple fact of non-engagement (it is reported that upon receiving Menger’s Investigations, he returned it unread to its author and published a ‘semi-review’ of it claiming that, indeed, it had not even been worth reading), Schmoller nonetheless retained his grip on the German university appointment system and kept Classical and Neoclassical economic theory largely out of German teaching—earning him the eternal enmity of the only potential challenger at the time, Menger’s Austrian School. Gustav Schmoller’s political involvements were also important, in 1872, he formed the Verein für Sozialpolitik, (‘Society for Social Policy’), a group of largely conservative economists which supported a kind of corporatist state-industry-labour nexus. Liberals deplored their advocacy for state interventionism and came to label Schmoller and the Historicists as Kathedersozialisten (or ‘Socialists of the Chair’)—a jest they never entirely lived down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hegelian_idealism;Hegelian Idealism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hegelian_idealism_desc;As neo-Kantian thinkers fought over the best way to interpret the knowledge Kant had developed, Hegel a rare breed among philosophers delivered his own version of idealist philosophy. Its main tenants were the philosophical view that the mind or spirit constitutes the fundamental reality which draw history onwards in a semi-deterministic fashion. His influence cannot be underestimated, among his disciples was the young Karl Marx who further developed this type of idealism though into a different direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
heinrich_schliemann;Heinrich Schliemann;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
heinrich_schliemann_desc;Heinrich Schliemann was a German businessman and archaeologist, and an advocate of the historical reality of places mentioned in the works of Homer. Schliemann was an archaeological excavator of Troy, along with the Mycenaean sites of Mycenae and Tiryns. His work lent weight to the idea that Homer’s Iliad and Virgil’s Aeneid reflect actual historical events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
helmet_mass_production;Mass-Produced Helmets;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
helmet_mass_production_desc;The use of artillery and modern machine guns renewed the need for steel helmets. They quickly became the standard among armed forces, from the French Adrian and the British Brodie to the German Stahlhelm. By the 20th century, such helmets offered protection for the head from shrapnel and fragments as well as for specialist roles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hermann_ebbinghaus;Hermann Ebbinghaus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hermann_ebbinghaus_desc;Hermann Ebbinghaus was a German psychologist who pioneered studies in memory. Ebbinghaus used himself as subject in thousands of repetitions of his ‘nonsense syllables’. Among his contributions to the field were the learning curve, the forgetting curve, and the serial position effect, which demonstrated that individuals remember the most recent information first presented. He documented ‘savings’: information relearned a second time is memorized faster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

human_resource_development;Human Resource Development;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
human_resource_development_desc;A theory of production management developed from the work of Elton Mayo based on research into productivity conducted at the Hawthorne Works in Chicago in the United States in the 1920s. Challenging the theories of Scientific Management, the Hawthorne Studies, and the interpretation of the data provided by Mayo, a more ‘human-centred’ approach to worker management as the key to improved productivity was developed. By making workers feel they were a valued part of the production process and not simply ‘cogs in the machine’ productivity would increase. While the analysis of the data was disputed by many researchers, the arguments gained influence as the twentieth century evolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
human_wave_doctrine;Human Wave Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

human_wave_vs_spearhead;Human Wave vs. Spearhead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
human_wave_vs_spearhead_desc;For those armies that focussed on mobility, it was important to decide how precisely the army was to be mobile. One option was to use standard infantry forces, and to overwhelm the enemy when contact was made, while another option was to focus on specialized spearhead units, often with a mechanized component, that were best suited for mobility and could quickly exploit weaknesses in the enemy line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hussar_activation;Hussars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hussar_activation_desc;Hussar refers to a number of types of light cavalry which originated in Hungary during the 15th century. The title and distinctive dress of these horsemen was subsequently widely adopted by light cavalry regiments in European and other armies. The hussars played a prominent role as cavalry in the Napoleonic Wars. As light cavalrymen mounted on fast horses, they would be used to fight skirmish battles and for scouting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hydraulic_excavator;Hydraulic Excavators;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hydraulic_excavator_desc;The very first excavator to use hydraulic technology was built in 1882 by Sir W. G. Armstrong & Company in England, where it was used in construction of the Hull docks. Unlike later excavators that use hydraulic fluid, water was used to operate the hydraulic functions. Also, it was not a true hydraulic machine, but a hybrid that used cables to operate the bucket but with a hydraulic cylinder operating a set of multiplying sheaves. The idea was not successful, neither on this machine nor on a machine of somewhat similar design built by the unrelated Frank F. Armstrong for Penn Iron Mining Company in the United States in 1914.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hyperinflation;Hyperinflation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hyperinflation_desc;For many nations, the socioeconomic strains caused by involvement in wars with other industrial nations resulted in huge deficits that made it impossible to return immediately to the gold standard. Some nations, facing new demands upon their incomes as a result of new social obligations to those involved in recent wars or obligations for being on the losing side of wars, found the demands too great, and sought to resolve their problems by expanding the amount of currency of circulation. With nothing to guarantee the value of the currency, the result would be to rapidly depreciate the value of the currency relative to other currencies or materials such as gold. The social impact of such government policies was traumatic, especially for those who lived on limited or fixed incomes or those who had investments denominated in the rapidly depreciating currency. To many, the willingness of the State to engage in such activity, and the market reaction to such activities, would lead to a search for alternative ideologies to restore order and stability in society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
i_analytic_philosophy;Analytic Philosophy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
i_analytic_philosophy_desc;This was originally a disparate movement of philosophers who wanted to free logics and the foundation of mathematics from elder defunct and inconsistent thesis. It later developed into trying to bridge language and formal logics and thus create an objective realist ground for reality. This took a side path into logical positivism. However, the objectivist position crashed as one of its early protégés Ludwig Wittgenstein took a 90 degree turn and tried to refute his own earlier position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
i_empiricism;Empiricism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
i_empiricism_desc;In its strong form, it is the thesis that there is no reality behind appearances. A weaker form of empiricism admits of the existence of a reality which is, however, trans-empirical.

i_scientific_management;Scientific Management;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
i_scientific_management_desc;A theory of production management developed by Frederick William Taylor in 1911 that asserted that worker productivity could be maximized by optimizing different tasks to those workers who are best able to perform those tasks. In combination with the provision of break times to workers to break the monotony of the daily work routine, Taylor’s theories of worker management and ‘fitting the worker to the job’ would come to be embraced as a basic tenet to maintaining and expanding production. However, one limit to Taylorism was its emphasis of the worker as simply part of the production process and as the twentieth century evolved some commentators came to see Taylor’s approach to worker management as a cause of increased interest in labour unions and socialism among the working class.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
import_substitution_industrialization;Import Substitution Industrialization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
import_substitution_industrialization_desc;The growth of the global economy in the nineteenth and early twentieth century resulted in increased demand for industrial goods by non-Western societies. However, the realities of war in the industrial age and increasing economic instability of periods of expansion and contraction resulted in non-Western societies at times being unable to meet their needs for industrial goods from the traditional producers of such goods in the West. As a result, an opening for producers in non-Western societies to meet the demand for those industrial goods that could not be acquired easily from the West arose, and industrialization in the non-Western world began to grow. Eventually pressure to protect these new industries from competition from overseas would lead some nations which had maintained political independence to adopt policies of import substitution industrialization to encourage their societies to break their dependence upon the West for industrial goods and, by extension, strengthen their own societies in the global economic system. Import substitution industrialization would gain in influence during the course of the twentieth century as the resources of the West were dedicated more towards resolving problems in the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

industrial_furniture_production;Industrial Furniture Production;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
industrial_furniture_production_desc;Where previously carpenters and joiners had made furniture along with every kind of building construction in wood, several circumstances combined to create a new profession: that of the cabinetmaker. The growth of cabinetmaking as a trade of its own eventually resulted in a considerable degree of standardization of methods of construction, particularly in the types of joints used and in the thicknesses of wood for the various parts. It also resulted in an increased division of labour: turners, carvers, chairmakers, upholsterers all worked in their respective roles to make and assemble furniture. In the new system of construction, plain, flat parts are dovetailed together and then veneered. It can be contrasted with the traditional framed method of rails and stiles put together with mortise and tenon joints, the panels fitting in grooves. A large store often retained its own workshops where special items were made to customers’ requirements, but for the greater part it became the practice to buy wholesale from furniture making firms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
industrial_luxury_furniture_production;Industrial Luxury Furniture Production;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
industrial_luxury_furniture_production_desc;Marquetry is the centrepiece of the decorative use of the grain and colour of wood in surfaces unbroken by panelling for luxury furniture. To produce the desired effect, the ébéniste, or specialist in marquetry, either drew the pattern directly on the base wood or affixed a paper pattern onto the wood. The thin sheets were then cut out with a burin or, later, sometimes with a saw, the pattern assembled and glued onto the carcass. Marquetry patterns became more and more complex and, though often floral, they could also include geometric and narrative subjects. The range of materials used also became more varied, including not only rare tropical woods and metals such as silver, bronze, and brass but also a wide range of other materials of a semiprecious nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
industrial_paper_production;Continuous Paper-Making Machines;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
industrial_paper_production_desc;Before the invention of continuous paper making, paper was made in individual sheets by stirring a container of pulp slurry and either pouring it into a fabric sieve called a sheet mould or dipping and lifting the sheet mould from the vat. While still on the fabric in the sheet mould, the wet paper was pressed to remove excess water. The sheet was then lifted off to be hung over a rope or wooden rod to air dry. The Fourdrinier machine, the first continuous one, changed all that. It uses a specially woven fabric mesh conveyor belt in the forming section, where a slurry of fibre is drained to create a continuous paper web, with paper left in a horizontal drainage area, referred to as the drainage table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

irving_fischer_desc;Irving Fisher was one of the earliest American Neoclassicals of unusual mathematical sophistication. He made numerous important contributions to the Neoclassical Marginalist Revolution. This Yale economist was an eccentric and colourful figure. When Irving Fisher wrote his 1892 dissertation, he constructed a remarkable machine equipped with pumps, wheels, levers and pipes in order to illustrate his price theory—see here for pictures of his draft and his first and second prototypes. Socially, he was an avid advocate of eugenics and health food diets. He made a fortune with his visible index card system—known today as the rolodex—and advocated the establishment of a 100 percent reserve requirement banking system. His fortune was lost and his reputation was severely marred by the 1929 Wall Street Crash, when just days before the crash, he was reassuring investors that stock prices were not overinflated but, rather, had achieved a new, permanent plateau.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ivan_pavlov_desc;Ivan Pavlov was a Russian physiologist and winner of the Nobel Prize for his work on reflexes in digestion. In the course of studies with dogs and salivation, Pavlov observed that the dogs elicited a certain type of salivation with certain signals that preceded the arrival of food. In his 1927 study, Pavlov laid out the basic principles of classical conditioning in Behaviourism. The food was the unconditioned stimulus for salivation. The signal became associated with salivation as a conditioned stimulus, with salivation to the sound of the signal alone becoming the new conditioned response. Extinction, recovery, generalization and discrimination were identified in subsequent studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jazz_desc;Originating in the fusion of Western musical tradition with elements of traditional African music, Jazz evolved out of the nightclubs of New Orleans in the southern United States in the early twentieth century. Its blend of frenetic, intoxicating rhythms, powerful melodies which encouraged improvisation by performers to add their own distinctive touches to each performance, and energetic vocals would hit upon the world just as new technologies to spread new music, such as the phonograph record, radio and sound cinema, provided a platform to showcase it to a worldwide audience. In the 1920s it became one of the dominant forms of popular music in the world, though many of the traditional arbiters of taste frowned upon its popularity as further proof that society was rebelling against proper authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jb_watson;John B. Watson;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jb_watson_desc;John Broadus Watson was an American psychologist who studied Pavlovian conditioning in humans. Watson’s most famous experiment involved conditioning an 11-year old child named Albert to associate a conditioned stimulus to an unconditioned stimulus. Watson’s research later led to clinical treatments extinguishing irrational fears in people. After being dismissed from Harvard over an affair and marriage with a graduate student, Watson brought his research experience to a prominent advertising firm. Modern advertising owed much to behaviourist psychology and conditioning concepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He became increasingly radical in his political views and after reading Karl Marx he began advocating socialism. He was not a revolutionary and supported the Independent Socialists. While out of parliament Jaurès completed his mammoth Socialist History of the French Revolution. He also joined with Aristide Briand and Rene Viviani in 1904 to establish the left-wing newspaper L’Humanité in 1904. A new Socialist Party under Jaurès grew rapidly at the beginning of the century but split over the correct response to German militarism.

Although educated at Göttingen, he spent most of his life managing his rural estate, Tellow. In the first volume of his treatise, ‘The Isolated State’, he laid down the first serious treatment of spatial economics, connecting with the theory of rent. His second volume developed the essence of the marginal productivity theory of distribution in a mathematically precise way, thereby making one of the most important Proto-Marginalists of the era. Nearing his death, he asked that his famous equation for the marginal product of labour, or natural wage, be carved into his tombstone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

john_elliot_cairnes_desc;John Elliot Cairnes was a follower of John Stuart Mill. His ‘The Slave Power’, a defence of the North in the American Civil War, made a great impression in England. He has written about noncompeting groups in the labour market and is known for his distrust of mathematical economics. Among his works are ‘The Character and Logical Method of Political Economy’ and ‘Some Leading Principles of Political Economy Newly Expounded’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
john_maynard_keynes;John Maynard Keynes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
john_maynard_keynes_desc;An English economist who challenged the orthodox view of the role of the State in the management of economic forces in society and the relationship between supply and demand in times of economic crisis. Drawing upon the abilities of states to mobilize their economies during wars with other industrial nations, Keynes maintained that the State could use its influence to promote more efficient economic development. But his most radical theory involved the role of aggregate demand in the economy, arguing that it was demand, not supply, that was the final determinant in the levels of output and growth that an economy could produce, and that in times of economic slowdown or crisis, the solution to the crisis involved revival of demand to absorb excess supply and create the conditions for a revival of production to meet further increases in demand. While his theories had many critics, they became highly influential as the twentieth century progressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
john_ramsay_mcculloch;John Ramsay McCulloch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
john_ramsay_mcculloch_desc;A prolific Scottish journalist, John Ramsay McCulloch was one of the most ardent and doctrinaire expositors of the Classical Ricardian School. McCulloch began his career as the editor of The Scotsman, eventually moving on to the whiggish Edinburgh Review, where he served as economics editor until the late 1830s. McCulloch used his position at the Review to popularize the Classical theories and promote his favourite economic policies, such as the repeal of the Corn Laws, the retention of the Poor Laws and the legalization of trade unions. McCulloch also lectured on political economy at University College London from 1828 to 1832. In 1838, he was appointed the Comptroller of HM Stationary Office. McCulloch’s main work, ‘Principles’ (1825), was perhaps the first successful ‘serious’ textbook in economics (and a rather loyal reading of Ricardo’s theory). However, McCulloch is often considered a ‘lightweight’ in terms of the development of economic theory. His main contribution was the ill-fated ‘wages fund’ doctrine (1824,1825, 1826). McCulloch was also the editor of the 1828 edition of Adam Smith’s ‘Wealth of Nations’ and the 1846 edition of David Ricardo’s works. He also composed some of the earliest accounts of the history of economic thought (naturally, flattering to the Ricardians). His monumental 1837 treatise provides a statistical account of the failure of the Malthusian population doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

joseph_schumpeter;Joseph Schumpeter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
joseph_schumpeter_desc;After a quick doctorate at Vienna, Schumpeter roamed about as something of a footloose lawyer until he re-joined academia in 1909. It was while he was teaching at Czernowitz (now in the Ukraine) that he wrote his Theory of Economic Development (1911), where he first outlined his famous theory of entrepreneurship. He argued those daring spirits, entrepreneurs, created technical and financial innovations in the face of competition and falling profits—and that it was these spurts of activity which generated (irregular) economic growth. In 1919, Schumpeter became the Austrian Minister of Finance—unfortunately, presiding over the hyperinflation of the period, and thus was dismissed later that year. Although excelling as a teacher above everything, Joseph Schumpeter nonetheless completed three more books while at Harvard: his didactic Business Cycles (1939), his popular Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy(1942)—in which he famously predicted the downfall of capitalism in the hands of intellectuals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jung;Carl Jung;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jung_desc;Carl Gustav Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist, an influential thinker, and the founder of analytical psychology. Jung is often considered the first modern psychologist to state that the human psyche is ‘by nature religious’ and to explore it in depth. Those not the first to analyse dreams, he has become perhaps one of the most well-known pioneers in the field of dream analysis. Unlike Freud, he was a self-described natural scientist and not a theoretical psychologist. For Jung this salient distinction revolved around his initial process of deep observation followed by categorizations rather than the reverse process of imagining what categories exist and then proceeding to seek for proof of and then discover that one was correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
karen_horney;Karen Horney;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
karen_horney_desc;Karen Horney was a German psychoanalyst. She came to criticize Freud’s emphasis on sex and aggressive as motivating drives. Horney focused on security instead as the central, inborn human need. In her view, child development was contingent upon parental fulfilment of the child’s ‘basic anxiety’ emotion. Success would result in a trusting individual, while failure would result in insecurity. Insecurity and distrust manifests itself in personality as either avoidance, submission or dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

karl_marx;Karl Marx;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
karl_marx_desc;Karl Marx was originally disciple of Hegel, but evolved his idealistic philosophy. Later in Paris he began mixing with members of the working class for the first time. Marx was shocked by their poverty but impressed by their sense of comradeship. In an article that he wrote for the Franco-German Annals, Marx applied Hegel’s dialectic theory to what he had observed in Paris. Marx, who now described himself as a communist, argued that the working class (the proletariat), would eventually be the emancipators of society. Marx’ most influential works were, The German Ideology, The Communist Manifesto, Principles of Communism, and Das Kapital. For most of his life he lived in England where he published his works and from where he became the most influential socialist of all time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
knut_wicksell;Knut Wicksell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
knut_wicksell_desc;He was a Swedish economist whose work led to the widespread use of the word ‘natural’ to explain the long-run equilibrium rate of interest. Wicksell had a tremendous influence on economist James M. Buchanan. According to Buchanan, his theory of public choice ‘was an almost natural consequence of my absorption of the Wicksellian message’, which stated that economists must cease acting as if government were a benevolent despot. Wicksell was a Malthusian and a strong advocate of birth control. He spoke out on moral issues quite often. He is best known for his work in ‘Interest and Prices’, in which he laid out his version of the quantity theory of money. His version was different from the standard view at that time in that he looked at the indirect effect that the money supply has on prices. Wicksell also elaborated on the theory of marginal productivity, which states that the payment to each factor of production equals that factors marginal productivity. He also stated that an efficient allocation of resources does not guarantee equitable distribution, because the pre-existing distribution of income determines what form this allocation will take, and the pre-existing distribution of income is not always just. The Stockholm School developed its own version of macroeconomics, which was based on Wicksell’s work on quantity and price theory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lancashire_loom_desc;The Lancashire Loom is a self-acting loom, though it has to be stopped to recharge empty shuttles. The principal advantage of the Lancashire loom was that it was semi-automatic, when a warp thread broke the weaver was notified. When the shuttle ran out of thread, the machine stopped. An operative thus could work 4 or more looms whereas previously they could only work a single loom. Indeed, the term A Four Loom Weaver was used to describe the operatives. Labour cost was quartered. In some mills an operative would operate 6 or even 8 looms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

leon_walras_desc;The French economist Léon Walras has been hailed by Joseph Schumpeter as ‘the greatest of all economists’. Walras was one of the three leaders of the Marginalist Revolution, even though his greatest work, ‘Elements of Pure Economics’, was published in 1874, three years after those of William Stanley Jevons and Carl Menger. Nonetheless, alone among the three revolutionaries, Léon Walras set forth the new ‘marginalist’ or ‘Neoclassical’ theory in a formal general equilibrium setting. Thus, he endowed it with the multi-market considerations Jevons had largely avoided and the mathematical precision Menger had eschewed. Léon Walras is widely and rightfully regarded as the father of general equilibrium theory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ludwig_von_mises_desc;An Austrian economist who would challenge the growing influence of Keynesian economics upon the actions of the State in the 1930s. Von Mises argued that the attempt by the State to use its resources to revive demand in the economy created dangerous potentials for inflation of the economy and severe imbalances in the ability of the marketplace to find the balance between supply and demand that would ensure stable economic growth. Von Mises was also a sharp critic of socialist economic models, arguing that such models removed the ability of the market to determine price levels that would ensure adequate supply based on the demands of consumers for goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mass_advertising_desc;The rapid spread of basic functional literacy in industrial societies combined with the improvements in communication technologies to lay the basis for the development of new approaches to the promotion of creating demand for the rapidly increasing output of goods by increasingly efficient industrial systems. Drawing upon increased understanding of the nature of human compulsions shaped by the environment around them, advertisers would also learn lessons gained by States in their propaganda efforts during periods of war to rally the population to support the goals of the nation in its conflict. The result would be a rapid expansion of the use of simple, direct means of advertising to popularize new products and increase the appeal and demand for established products would become permanent features of popular culture as the twentieth century evolved, and would eventually come to impact other realms of public life, including politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

national_radio_networks;National Radio Networks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
national_radio_networks_desc;As the twentieth century evolved the role of wireless communication pioneered in the development of radio by Guglielmo Marconi would rapidly increase as technological changes improved the clarity and quality of radio transmissions. By the early 1920s the improvements would result in the development of a whole new medium of information exchange as radio frequencies could be used to transmit content designed to entertain, inform, or convince. Realizing the potential power of this new medium, states began to regulate the assigning of radio frequencies, with some establishing national monopolies while others allowed for the development of commercial broadcasting networks. By the early 1930s the radio set would become one of the most desired consumer goods, and its potential use to not only entertain but develop and shape public opinion would soon be seized upon by politicians and those who aspired to political power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

neokantian_idealism_desc;Kant’s transcendental idealism had meant that the world can only be understood through categories, or ideal concepts that are immanent in us, and empirically. This is sometimes called weak empiricism. The neo-Kantian idealist, however, departed very far from Kant and more or less went back to a more classical idealism though interpreted in a Kantian language referring to categories in their analyses of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neoliberal_theory;Nepotism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neoliberal_theory_desc;Originally neoliberalism was an economic philosophy that emerged among European liberal scholars in the 1930s attempting to trace a so-called ‘Third’ or ‘Middle Way’ between the conflicting philosophies of classical liberalism and collectivist central planning. The impetus for this development arose from a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the early 1930s, which were mostly blamed on the economic policy of classical liberalism. In the decades that followed, the use of the term neoliberal tended to refer to theories at variance with the more laissez-faire doctrine of classical liberalism and promoted instead a market economy under the guidance and rules of a strong state, a model which came to be known as the social market economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nihilism_and_the_will;Nihilism And The Will;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nihilism_and_the_will_desc;The foundations for the trend away from the emphasis on human rationality in philosophy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries would be established with a revival in the interest among some philosophers in nihilism, the rejection of the idea that the life of the individual has any meaning or purpose in the grand workings of the universe. In place of the self-value of the individual as a being, focus was placed on The Will, the human ability to intervene in a situation to his own benefit. Developed most effectively in the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche in the late nineteenth century, the dramatic impact of warfare in the industrial era would lead to further refinement of the concept by philosophers such as Martin Heidegger in the early twentieth century. In its denial of the value of absolutes as guides for the conduct of human behaviour, Nihilism would help contribute to the further questioning, and for many the ultimate rejection, of the values and beliefs that had shaped the Victorian world, while the emphasis on Will would encourage action to challenge accepted practices and encourage the construction of new values.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

paramilitary_groups_desc;As a result of the huge manpower requirements of militaries in an age of industrial warfare, the restoration of peace often resulted in the creation of large numbers of veterans, many of whom found it difficult to adjust to a return to civilian life and who possessed basic military training that could be put to use if needed. With the growth of revolutionary movements on the Left and particularly on the Right, the potential use of disgruntled military veterans for the purpose of challenging the actions and influence of ideological opponents grew rapidly. Their existence and growth in times of political, social and economic upheaval proved challenging to the ability of many States to maintain law and order, and the activities of such paramilitaries were often cited by those opposed to Liberal Capitalism of the inherent weakness of democracy in the face of revolutionary challenges that threatened the social order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
parkes_process;Parkes Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
parkes_process_desc;The Parkes process is a pyrometallurgical process for removing silver from lead during the production of bullion. The process takes advantage of two liquid-state properties of zinc. The first is that zinc is immiscible with lead, and the other is that silver is 3000 times more soluble in zinc than it is in lead. When zinc is added to liquid lead that contains silver as a contaminant, the silver preferentially migrates into the zinc. Because the zinc is immiscible in the lead it remains in a separate layer and is easily removed. The zinc-silver solution is then heated until the zinc vaporizes, leaving nearly pure silver. If gold is present in the liquid lead, it can also be removed and isolated by the same process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

percussion_drill;Pneumatic Drill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
percussion_drill_desc;In Europe since the late 1840s, the king of Sardinia, Carlo Alberto, had been contemplating the excavation of a 12-kilometre (7.5 mi) tunnel through Mount Fréjus to create a rail link between Italy and France, which would cross his realm. The need for a mechanical rock drill was obvious and this sparked research on pneumatic rock drills in Europe. A Frenchman, Cavé, designed, and in 1851 patented, a rock drill that used compressed air, but the air had to be admitted manually to the cylinder during each stroke, so it was not successful. In 1854, in England, Thomas Bartlett made and then patented (1855) a rock drill whose drill bit was connected directly to the piston of a steam engine. In 1855 Bartlett demonstrated his drill, powered by compressed air, to officials of the Mount Fréjus tunnel project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It doesn’t ask what particular words mean, or whether particular sentences are true. Except of course for words and sentences about the language. Rather, it asks what meaning and truth in general are. It was developed out of Wittgenstein’s critique of his own earlier work ‘Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus’, and to some extent the whole analytic tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pierre_joseph_proudhon;Pierre Joseph Proudhon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pierre_joseph_proudhon_desc;Proudhon was apprenticed as a printer and became interested in politics after he was involved in the printing of ‘The New Industrial and Cooperative World’ by Charles Fourier. Proudhon now turned to writing and in 1843 published ‘What is Property?’ In the book Proudhon attacks the injustices of inequality and coined the phrase, ‘property is theft’. Proudhon published his most important work, ‘System of Economic Contradictions’, was published in 1846. Karl Marx responded to Proudhon’s book by writing ‘The Poverty of Philosophy’ (1847). This was the beginning of the long-term struggle of ideas between the two men. Proudhon was opposed to Marx’s authoritarianism and his main influence was on the libertarian socialist movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

post_napoleonic_army_doctrine;Post-Napoleonic Army Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_napoleonic_army_doctrine_desc;The French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars that followed revolutionized military strategy. The impact of this period was still to be felt in the American Civil War and the early phases of World War I. With the advent of cheap small arms and the rise of the drafted citizen soldier, armies grew rapidly in size to become massed formations. This necessitated dividing the army first into divisions and later into corps. Along with divisions came divisional artillery lightweight, mobile cannon with great range and firepower. The rigid formations of pikemen and musketeers firing massed volleys gave way to light infantry fighting in skirmish lines’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
poudre_b;Poudre B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
poudre_b_desc;Meaning ‘poudre blanch’ or ‘white powder’, Poudre B was the first practical smokeless gunpowder, three times more powerful than black powder for the same weight.

priming_the_pump_;Priming The Pump;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
priming_the_pump__desc;In wake of a series of economic shocks that shook the world in the first part of the twentieth century some politicians would become influenced by new economic theories regarding supply and demand and their interplay in times of economic crisis. Based upon the concept that money spent in the economy has a multiplier effect that increases economic activity by generating income that can contribute to new demand, some politicians made appeals in wake of economic declines for ‘priming the pump’ to re-inflate demand and thus resume economic growth. Not all politicians and economist accepted this argument, and to some such state intervention appeared as an introduction of socialist principles into the economy, but the political impact of having the State appear to be actively trying to improve economic conditions made such political promises very appealing to those negatively impacted by economic downturns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

quantum_theory;Quantum Theory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quantum_theory_desc;The dramatic expansion of scientific knowledge in the nineteenth century would lead to a questioning of the rational model of the basic structures of the universe that had culminated in the work of Isaac Newton in the late seventeenth century. As scientific equipment became more precise, discrepancies in the models of atomic behaviour as understood in the nineteenth century resulted in further research into the nature of atomic particles and their interaction with forces such as energy. As a result of the work of physicists such as Albert Einstein and Walter Heisenberg, the idea that the basic structures of the universe could be known with precision by humans was shown to be incorrect, and an alternative view that there were elements of unpredictability in the structure and behaviour of atomic particles would be proposed. While a major step forward in human understanding of the basic structures of matter, the emphasis of the random nature of some elements of the natural world further shook the Victorian faith in the ability of humanity to understand fully the natural world and reinforced the sense that the world was indeed not built upon completely rational behaviour and assumptions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

richard_kahn;Richard Kahn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
richard_kahn_desc;An English economist who first developed the concept of the multiplier effect of spending in an economy in the early 1930s. At its base, this is the concept that spending in the economy for goods and services produced new potentials for demand by the providers of those initial goods and services, creating an expansion of demand beyond the initial value of the original spending. Adopted by John Maynard Keynes in his concept of the role of aggregate demand in the functioning of the economy, the concept of the multiplier effect would be increasingly adopted by States facing economic slowdowns by encouraging the State itself to increase its spending in the economy as a way to revive weakened demand and restore economic growth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

rotary_kiln_desc;The Rotary ‘endless’ kiln gives perfect control over combustion and produces a better grade of cement. The kiln is a cylindrical vessel, inclined slightly to the horizontal, which is rotated slowly about its axis. The material to be processed is fed into the upper end of the cylinder. As the kiln rotates, material gradually moves down towards the lower end, and may undergo a certain amount of stirring and mixing. Hot gases pass along the kiln, sometimes in the same direction as the process material, but usually in the opposite direction. The hot gases may be generated in an external furnace or may be generated by a flame inside the kiln.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

schrapnel_standard_design;Shrapnel Standard Design;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
schrapnel_standard_design_desc;Shrapnel shells were anti-personnel artillery munitions which carried a large number of individual bullets close to the target and then ejected them to allow them to continue along the shell’s trajectory and strike the target individually. They relied almost entirely on the shell’s velocity for their lethality. The final shrapnel shell design bore little similarity to Henry Shrapnel’s original design, marking the quick evolution of technology at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
schwerpunkt;Schwerpunkt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
schwerpunkt_desc;Schwerpunkt is a term referring to the ‘centre of gravity or point of maximum effort, where a decisive action could be achieved’. Ground, mechanised and tactical air forces could be concentrated at this point of maximum effort whenever possible.

shrinkage_stoping;Shrinkage Stoping;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shrinkage_stoping_desc;Shrinkage stoping is a mining method used for steeply dipping, narrower ore bodies with self-supporting walls and ore. It is an overhand mining method that relies on broken ore being left in the stope to be used as the ‘working floor’ and to support the walls. During the mining cycle, only 30 – 35% of the ore blasted is extracted being equivalent to the swell factor of in-situ ore to broken. When mining is complete to the next upper horizon, the ore is extracted. Although it is not necessary to fill the resulting voids, they are commonly filled with waste rock from development. Level intervals seldom exceed 40 meters due to uneven muck draw. Recoverable pillars are left at each level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sidney_webb;Sidney Webb;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sidney_webb_desc;Webb developed socialist ideas while at university and in 1885 he joined the Fabian Society. The society believed that capitalism had created an unjust and inefficient society.

socialist_realism;Socialist Realism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
socialist_realism_desc;The growing split between elite and popular forms of cultural production in the early twentieth century would merge with the rise of new anti-liberal political ideologies to result in a backlash against the cultural avant-garde by the growing power of the State in the name of ‘the people’. In both fascist and communist regimes, a new artistic ethos would develop that encouraged production that the masses could not only understand but encourage the installation of the values that these regimes wished to instil upon the societies they governed. For the cultural elite, a stark choice was offered, either accept the limits of creativity imposed by the State in one’s work or face the retribution of the State for challenging its authority. In communist regimes this new artistic ethos came to be known as Socialist Realism, but fascist regimes had their own analogous stylistic ethos which was imposed from above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

square_set_timbering;Square-Set Timbering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
square_set_timbering_desc;Square-set timbering is a system invented by a German named Philip Deidesheimer that uses heavy timber ‘cubes’ as supports for underground mining tunnels and shafts, that enabled skilled miners to open three-dimensional cavities of any size. In large openings, the cubes can be filled with waste rock, creating a solid pillar of wood and rock from floor to roof (‘back’ in miner’s terminology). The system, which was inspired by the structure of honeycombs, enabled mining of the large silver orebodies of the Comstock Lode, which were in very weak rock—in miner’s terms, ‘heavy ground’. Deidesheimer refused to patent the innovation, which was easily the most important mining innovation of 1860.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

stanley_jevons;Stanley Jevons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
stanley_jevons_desc;The impact of Jevons on economics can hardly be exaggerated. As the father of Neoclassical economics, his legacy is secure. However, in some ways, he stopped short of the mark. Jevons could have gone further by connecting his insights in pure exchange into a wider theory incorporating production, capital, money and the business cycle in a more systematic and consistent manner that would have knocked the Ricardian School completely out of the picture. Had he not died so young, Jevons might yet have done so, but the next economics treatise he was working on (published posthumously in 1905), did not really seem to go in that ambitious direction. As such, by the time of his death, the Marginalist Revolution was still in its insurrectionist phase. It was still a tentative proposition rather than a firmly-set and integrated system, a scientific hypothesis but not quite yet a science. It should be noted that Jevons made maybe as much for the subject of Logics as for economics, which is quite a feat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_decline_of_the_west_and_the_lost_generation;The Decline of the West and the Lost Generation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_decline_of_the_west_and_the_lost_generation_desc;The combination of the dramatic social, economic and political transformations undertaken in the nineteenth century with the rise of industry and the devastation produced by mass warfare in the industrial age created a crisis of confidence among many intellectuals that the whole structure of society was under siege and in danger of complete collapse. Oswald Spengler began work on ‘The Decline Of The West’ in 1911 as the challenges of new social, political and economic forces were shaking advanced industrial societies to their cores, with Spengler concluding that what these societies were experiencing was part of the natural cycle of civilizations that rise, have a period of brilliance, and eventually decline and collapse—a direct challenge to the Victorian idea that modern industrial society could continually be improved as a result of humanity’s rational abilities. Coined by American author Gertrude Stein, ‘The Lost Generation’ captured the sense of loss and emptiness that many veterans of Great War felt after surviving the carnage of the battlefields and questioning the values and beliefs that had encouraged their nations to participate in the conflicts in the first place. These themes of decline and loss that Spengler and Woolf developed would dominate the cultural landscape in the early twentieth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_doctrine_of_fascism;The Doctrine of Fascism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_doctrine_of_fascism_desc;The spread of revolutionary Communism in the early twentieth century as a potential alternative model to Liberal Capitalism as the basis of the organization of society would lead to the development of new models on the political Right that sought to offer a third alternative that would replace the weaknesses inherent in Liberal Capitalist systems without promoting a social revolution that would dispossess the power and status of the upper and middle classes. By the early 1920s such a model would crystallize in the evolution of Fascism. Although less rigorously defined in terms of ideological content than Communism, Fascism at its base called for the reorganization of The State for the benefit of The Nation as a whole, so that all who are defined as members of the national community, regardless of socioeconomic class, receive the benefits of modern industrial society. This would be achieved by subsuming the desires and concerns of the individual to the needs of the Nation under the leadership of a single party that would govern according to the needs of the Nation as a whole and prepare the Nation to compete successfully with other nations for power and influence in the world. Fully elaborated in the writings of the Italian Giovanni Gentile in the early 1930s, Fascism as an alternative to both Liberal Capitalism and Communism would grow rapidly in the early twentieth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_revolt_of_the_masses;The Revolt of the Masses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_revolt_of_the_masses_desc;The move towards the establishment of universal suffrage as the basis for determining the balance of political power in society led to an increased sense of hope that with democracy the issues and concerns of The People would finally be addressed. The resulting factionalism caused by the growth of political parties in wake of universal suffrage soon exposed the limitations of liberal democracy as a system for the arbitration of power in society (especially in times of social, economic or political crisis) and led to a great deal of disenchantment with the ideals of democracy as the best system of governance and a search for potential alternatives to more effectively achieve the promises of a better life for all. Written in 1930 by the Spanish intellectual Jose Ortega y Gasset, ‘The Revolt Of The Masses’ warns of the potential threat to the ideal of liberal democracy in its current limitations and the potential for the masses to overwhelm the political system and replace it with alternatives that in the end would destroy the basic principles of classic liberal democracy unless liberal democracy was able to reform itself to meet the challenges produced by mass politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_talkies_desc;The development of the cinema in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century would result in the creation of a new mass cultural activity that would soon become one of the hallmarks of the era. The power and influence of the cinema would be further enhanced when in the 1920s technological improvements allowed for the ability of sounds to be synchronized with the moving images so that not just the visual representation of a scene could be represented on screen, but its aural component as well. ‘The Jazz Singer,’ released in the United States in 1927, was the first sound motion picture, and within half a decade the silent movie had become a relic of the past, and a new, powerful medium had entered the public sphere, forever changing not only popular culture, but the nature of politics and international relations as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

thorstein_veblen;Thorstein Veblen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
thorstein_veblen_desc;Thorstein Veblen is to economics what Jonathan Swift is to English literature: a master of the art of satire. Is essential to effective satire that its message be ambiguous: the reader should never be sure whether the author is absolutely serious or just pulling his or her leg That quality is certainly present in Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels and it is also present in Veblen’s Theory of the Leisure Class, The Instinct of Workmanship, Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution, The Higher Learning in America, Absentee Ownership, and his many essays. In fact, it is there in everything he wrote except The Theory of Business Enterprise, which is as near as he ever came to write a conventional academic book. No matter which of these books we open, we find the idea that life in a modern industrial community is the result of a polar conflict between ‘pecuniary employments’ and ‘industrial employments’, between ‘business enterprise’ and ‘the machine process’, between ‘vendibility’ and ‘serviceability’—in short, between making money and making goods. There is a class struggle under capitalism, not between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, but between businessmen and engineers. Pecuniary habits of thought unite bankers, brokers, lawyers and managers in a defence of private acquisition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

trinitrotoluene;TNT;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
trinitrotoluene_desc;Trinitrotoluene, or TNT, was first prepared in 1863 by German chemist Julius Wilbrand and originally used as a yellow dye. Its potential as an explosive was not recognized for several years, mainly because it was so difficult to detonate and because it was less powerful than alternatives. Its explosive properties were first discovered by another German chemist, Carl Häussermann, in 1891. TNT is one of the most commonly used explosives for military, industrial, and mining applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tulls_seed_drill_desc;Up until this era, farmers planted the seeds for cereal crops by carrying the seeds in a bag and walking up and down the field throwing or broadcasting the seed. They broadcast the seed by hand on to the ploughed and harrowed ground. The problem with this method was that it did not give a very even distribution. It was not, therefore, an efficient use of the seed and much of it was wasted. Jethro Tull invented a Seed Drill which could be pulled behind a horse. It consisted of a wheeled vehicle containing a box filled with grain. There was a wheel-driven ratchet that sprayed the seed out evenly as the Seed Drill was pulled across the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Once the triode was established as an amplifier it made a tremendous difference to radio receiver performance as it allowed the incoming signals to be amplified. This gave significant improvements in the levels of gain that could be achieved, greatly increasing selectivity, enabling this type of receiver to outperform all other types of the era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vanguard_party;Vanguard Party;Parti d'avant-garde;Vorreiterpartei;;Partido vanguardia;;;;;;;;;x
vanguard_party_desc;As the Socialist movement grew in influence in some industrial nations, in other societies that were less industrialized the idea that the working class could lead an overthrow of the State and seize power was realized to be limited. Coined by the Russian socialist Vladimir Lenin in 1902, the concept of the vanguard party was that a small group of dedicated revolutionaries could lead the struggle for revolution in the name of the masses who lacked the ability or desire to carry out revolution themselves and, having achieved power in their name, establish control over the State and carry out the transformations necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of the socialist movement, the worker’s utopia. While most influential within Leftist political circles in the early twentieth century, the concept of an ideological vanguard seizing power on behalf of groups in society as a whole would also be influential on the Right as ultra-nationalist movements began to move towards a more concrete ideological system, Fascism;;Während in manchen Industrienationen sozialistische Bewegungen an Einfluss gewannen, erkannte man in weniger industrialisierten Gesellschaften, dass die Idee, die Arbeiterklasse könne den Staat stürzen und die Macht an sich reißen, Einschränkungen unterworfen war. Das vom russischen Sozialisten Wladimir Lenin 1902 geprägte Konzept der Vorreiterpartei besagte, dass eine kleine Gruppe entschlossener Revolutionäre den revolutionären Kampf im Namen der Massen führen konnte, denen es selbst an der Fähigkeit oder dem Wunsch zur Durchführung der Revolution fehlte. Dabei sollte die Kontrolle über den Staat gewonnen und alle notwendigen Änderungen zum Erreichen des ultimativen Ziels der sozialistischen Bewegung, der Arbeiter-Utopie, durchgeführt werden. Während das Konzept der ideologischen Vorreiterpartei, im Auftrag gesellschaftlicher Gruppen die Macht zu ergreifen, als Ganzes Anfang des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts in leninistischen Kreise größten Einfluss hatte, machte man es sich auch in rechtsgerichteten Kreisen zunutze, als sich ultra-nationalistische Bewegungen einem konkreteren ideologischem System annäherten, nämlich dem Faschismus.;;Mientras el socialismo aumentaba su influencia en algunos países industrializados, en otras sociedades que no lo eran tanto se hizo evidente que la idea de que la clase trabajadora podía encabezar el derrocamiento del Estado y hacerse con el poder era poco probable. Acuñado por el socialista revolucionario ruso Vladimir Lenin en 1902, el concepto del partido como vanguardia afirmaba que un pequeño grupo de revolucionarios decididos podía encabezar la lucha por la revolución en nombre de unas masas que carecían de la capacidad o el deseo de llevarla a cabo por sí mismas y, tras hacerse con el poder en su nombre, controlar todos los resortes del poder y llevar a cabo las transformaciones necesarias para alcanzar el objetivo final del movimiento socialista, la utopía de los trabajadores. Influyente sobre todo en los círculos políticos de izquierda de comienzos del siglo XX, el concepto de una vanguardia ideológica capaz de apoderarse del poder en beneficio de grupos sociales también tendría su calado en la derecha cuando los movimientos ultranacionalistas comenzaran a engendrar un sistema ideológico más concreto, el fascismo.;;;;;;;;;x

william_cunningham;William Cunningham;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
william_cunningham_desc;Cunningham was a vocal opponent of the nascent Neoclassical economics, particularly as propounded by his colleague, Alfred Marshall and the Cambridge School. In economics, he sought to promote the historical method, making him one of the most leading advocates of the English Historical School. Despite the sustained attacks levied by Cunningham, Marshall was sufficiently influenced by his pleas to try to include some more historical content in his work and operate more ‘inductively’ in the derivation of his economic principles. However, he refused to accept Cunningham’s main charge — that the validity of economic laws is conditional on historical, social and cultural context. Cunningham’s opposition to Neoclassicism was not only one of method, but also of politics. Cunningham was deeply opposed to utilitarian philosophy and laissez-faire politics, and penned several tracts defending labour unions and protectionism. He also resurrected much interest in old Mercantilist thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wireless;Wireless;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wireless_desc;An important development in naval warfare in the early-20th century was the wireless, or radio communications. This allowed naval headquarters to communicate with fleets at sea in order to give updated orders, and also allowed admirals to communicate much more effectively with individual warships in their fleets, in comparison with older methods such as signal flags. However, one drawback of wireless was that it was also possible for the enemy to listen in on wireless communications, and soon the major navies would establish organizations to glean valuable intelligence from enemy communications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

absorption_refrigerators;Absorption Refrigerators;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
absorption_refrigerators_desc;The basic principle behind absorption refrigerators is that certain chemicals, such as ammonia and water, can be used to create a refrigeration cycle that operates using only heat as an energy source. The process involves heating a mixture of ammonia and water, causing the ammonia to vaporize and separate from the water. The ammonia vapor is then cooled, which causes it to condense back into a liquid. This liquid ammonia is then mixed with water, which absorbs the heat generated during the process, allowing the cycle to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
