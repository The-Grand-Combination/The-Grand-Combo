EVTNAME50000;Republican Revolution?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50000;The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. To avert a republican backlash, the government adopted a series of credit and military policies and reforms to appease the land owners. The measures made by the government alarmed the civilian republicans and the Positivists in the military corps. They saw that it would undercut support for their own aims, and were emboldened to further action. For them, it had become a case of ‘now or never’. Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring the Positivist officers to overthrow the monarchy. The Positivists launched a coup d’état and tried to institute a republic on November 15, 1889. During the whole ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He only commented:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50002;Vargas was born in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, into a family prominent in state politics. By 1922 he had risen rapidly in state politics and was elected to the National Congress, in which he served for four years. In 1926 Vargas became minister of finance in the Cabinet of President Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa, a post he retained until his election as governor of Rio Grande do Sul in 1928. From his position as state governor, Vargas campaigned unsuccessfully as reform candidate for the presidency of Brazil in 1930. While appearing to accept defeat, Vargas in October of that year led the revolution, organized by his friends, that overthrew the oligarchical republic. For the next 15 years Vargas assumed largely dictatorial powers, ruling most of that time without a congress. He held sole power as provisional president from Nov. 3, 1930, until July 17, 1934, when he was elected president by the constituent assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50003;The village of Paraibuna emerged in the early nineteenth century due to the occupation of the region by families of farmers and settlers coming of the former gold producing region (Ouro Preto and Mariana). The county of Paraibuna was separated from Barbacena on May 31, 1850, and was elevated to Paraibuna City in 1856, surpassing the city of São João del Rey. In 1865 the city of Paraibuna was renamed Juiz de Fora.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50009;The course of Venezuelan history changed markedly at the turn of the 20th century. In 1899 General Cipriano Castro, a caudillo from the Andean state of Táchira, descended on Caracas with his provincial army and seized the presidency. As a result, five successive military strongmen from Táchira, known as Andinos, controlled the nation for the next 59 years, except for an interlude in 1945-48. The longest rule being the one of General Juan Vicente Gómez. Gómez was an effective, if ruthless, dictator. By manipulating elections, abolishing all organized political activity, and monopolizing appointive powers, he established a completely subservient legislative and judicial structure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
