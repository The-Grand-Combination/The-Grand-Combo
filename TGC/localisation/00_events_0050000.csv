EVTNAME50000;Republican Revolution?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50000;The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. To avert a republican backlash, the government adopted a series of credit and military policies and reforms to appease the land owners. The measures made by the government alarmed the civilian republicans and the Positivists in the military corps. They saw that it would undercut support for their own aims, and were emboldened to further action. For them, it had become a case of ‘now or never’. Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring the Positivist officers to overthrow the monarchy. The Positivists launched a coup d’état and tried to institute a republic on November 15, 1889. During the whole ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He only commented:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50002;Vargas was born in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, into a family prominent in state politics. By 1922 he had risen rapidly in state politics and was elected to the National Congress, in which he served for four years. In 1926 Vargas became minister of finance in the Cabinet of President Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa, a post he retained until his election as governor of Rio Grande do Sul in 1928. From his position as state governor, Vargas campaigned unsuccessfully as reform candidate for the presidency of Brazil in 1930. While appearing to accept defeat, Vargas in October of that year led the revolution, organized by his friends, that overthrew the oligarchical republic. For the next 15 years Vargas assumed largely dictatorial powers, ruling most of that time without a congress. He held sole power as provisional president from Nov. 3, 1930, until July 17, 1934, when he was elected president by the constituent assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50003;The village of Paraibuna emerged in the early nineteenth century due to the occupation of the region by families of farmers and settlers coming of the former gold producing region (Ouro Preto and Mariana). The county of Paraibuna was separated from Barbacena on May 31, 1850, and was elevated to Paraibuna City in 1856, surpassing the city of São João del Rey. In 1865 the city of Paraibuna was renamed Juiz de Fora.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50004;García Moreno's death in 1875, as he himself might have forecast, brought a period of near anarchy. Conservatives and liberals struggled for power. But Ecuador had become part of the world market: the importance of the coast slowly increased, and the liberals of that area increasingly dominated the economy. A new liberal hero emerged from the lower classes as the leader of the coastal reaction to Sierra conservatism and clericalism. A man of great personal magnetism, Gen. Eloy Alfaro led a march against the Sierra in $YEAR$ and after a year...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50006;After the War of the Pacific, a vigorous debate among civilian elites spawned the development of new political parties. Mining entrepreneurs, who had become the most important economic group in the country, created the Conservative Party. Conservatives favored reaching a quick peace settlement with Chile that would include indemnification for lost territories and enable Bolivia to construct a railroad for mining exports. The Liberal Party denounced the pacifism of the Conservatives. Despite these differences, both parties were primarily interested in political and economic modernization, and their ideological outlooks were similar. The governments in power elected by a small, literate electorate brought Bolivia its first relative political stability and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50008;In $YEAR$, Nicolás de Piérola, after allying his party with the Civil Party of Peru to organize guerrillas with fighters to occupy Lima, ousted Andrés Avelino Cáceres and once again became president of Peru. After a brief period in which the military once again controlled the country, civilian rule was permanently established with Pierola's election. His second term was marked by his reconstruction of a devastated Peru by initiating fiscal, military, religious, and civil reforms. Until the 1920s, this period was called the "Aristocratic Republic", since most of the presidents that ruled the country were from the social elite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50009;The course of Venezuelan history changed markedly at the turn of the 20th century. In 1899 General Cipriano Castro, a caudillo from the Andean state of Táchira, descended on Caracas with his provincial army and seized the presidency. As a result, five successive military strongmen from Táchira, known as Andinos, controlled the nation for the next 59 years, except for an interlude in 1945-48. The longest rule being the one of General Juan Vicente Gómez. Gómez was an effective, if ruthless, dictator. By manipulating elections, abolishing all organized political activity, and monopolizing appointive powers, he established a completely subservient legislative and judicial structure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50010;William Lindsay Scruggs was the US ambassador to both Colombia and Venezuela, and has always been on good terms with our government and an advocate for good relations between our countries. With some persuasion, we can probably get him to lobby for our cause in Washington, pointing out the hypocrisy in not supporting our claims against that of an European colonial power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50010;A diplomatic opportunity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50010;Let him go and shame Uncle Sam into action!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB50010;Let us not tempt fate with such a brash callout.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50011;In $YEAR$ Scruggs was recruited by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Government to operate on its behalf in Washington D.C. as a lobbyist and legal attache. As a lobbyist, Scruggs published the pamphlet entitled 'British Aggressions in $FROMCOUNTRY$: The Monroe Doctrine on Trial'. In the pamphlet, he attacked "British aggression" claiming that $FROMCOUNTRY$ was anxious to arbitrate over the $FROMCOUNTRY$/British Guiana border dispute of territory at west of Essequibo river limited by Schomburgk Line. Scruggs also claimed that British policies in the disputed territory violated the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. \n \nSuch a public callout of our inaction will be a disaster to our influence in the region if not contained. We must defend the Monroe doctrine, but we should also be cautious of our relations with the other great powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50012;The border between the formerly Spanish territories in Guyana has never been solidly determined - while the Schombugk line marked out the material state of affairs, both sides have had extended claims, and an informal dispute has existed since the 1840s. \nRecently the Venezuelans have lobbied in Washington for the Americans to back them under the Monroe doctrine, and they now demand that we leave Guyana altogether.

EVTDESC50017;The British are offering to sell their holdings on the left bank of the Essequibo if they would be reimbursed for their future losses. While this may make them appear the reasonable party to the outside world, it is clear that they are just looking for reasons to use to dispute the sale later on. It also might not be seen as a popular move to invest so heavily for what many percieve as a worthless strip of land a continent away, for a nation that neither could nor would do the same for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50017;The British offer to sell the territory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50017;They insult us! Powder and steel will determine our domain, not gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

If we can gain his favor, we can trap the Americans, offering them a saving grace of a unanimous decision in our favor, or a contested 3-2 decision that still favors us, with greater territorial claims. We are confident they will se reason and side with us, but it may be disastrous for our diplomatic image if the plot is found out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50020;The arbitration committee for the border between our holdings in Guyana and Venezuela had, to the shock of many, found against us. Britain's key argument was that prior to Venezuela's independence, Spain had not taken effective possession of the disputed territory and said that the local Indians had had alliances with the Dutch, which gave them a sphere of influence that the British acquired in 1814. The American arbitrators found the British argument preposterous since American Indians had never been considered to have any sovereignty.\n \nWhile it may be extremely unpopular with the international community, we can just ignore the committee's decision and call the Americans' bluff on whether they would actually go to war over this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
