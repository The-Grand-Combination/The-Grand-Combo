EVTDESC1010011;For years, British committees have looked into the situation in Ireland and predicted disaster: the Irish farmers had become more and more dependent on their potato crop, and if anything were to happen to that crop it would cause not only widespread chaos throughout the Irish economy but famine and worse. Their predictions have come true. A blight has been spreading, leading to failure after failure of the Irish potato harvest. Proponents of laissez-faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise. Others claim that no expense is too high to help the Irish, and that failure to act quickly will lead to starvation and resentment… but conservatives are quick to dismiss this as inflammatory nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010012;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$.

EVTDESC1010014;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$. With the local harvest quickly failing, the effects are already being felt-in $PROVINCENAME$, the Irish are gathering in large crowds to receive aid sent by the British government. While they are grateful, times are still incredibly difficult and it’s clear many are considering leaving Ireland to take their chances in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010015;An aborted attempt at an uprising recently took place in the village of Ballingarry, Ireland. A group of Irish nationalists, frustrated by what they call the inept handling of the recent famine by the British government, engaged in a long gunfight with a unit of constabulary until reinforcements arrived and drove the men off. Many of these nationalists have since been captured and tried, but the event has sparked an increase in nationalism across the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1010015;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010016;Not content to wait until the dust of the war has settled, nationalists in Ireland have taken to the streets of $PROVINCENAME$ to call for the end of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. With our forces engaged elsewhere, their calls have quickly swept across all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1010016;When the war is done, there shall be consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010020;The tone among the people in our Irish territories has changed. Many Irish nationalist who emigrated to the United States founded a militant organization called the Fenian Brotherhood there, a group dedicated to freeing Ireland from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control… and now they have formed a sister organization back home, the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Already they are stirring up trouble, and it seems certain they will continue until some manner of home rule is attained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010020;The Irish Republican Brotherhood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010020;Perhaps the time has come to examine the Irish situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010021;We’ve received reports that the Irish Republican Brotherhood has been active in $PROVINCENAME$, spreading propaganda and generally stirring up agitation against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.

EVTOPTA1010021;This is a serious issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1010022;This simply makes things far more difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010023;In an event organized by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a group of Irish nationalists seized key locations in the city of $PROVINCENAME$ on Easter Monday, kicking off the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010024;Spurred on by increased public sympathy towards the Irish Republican Brotherhood following the Easter Rising, the Sinn Féin have won a majority of seats in Ireland during the last election. They have gathered in Dublin and declared themselves Dáil Éireann, the parliament of Ireland, and demanded that Ireland be granted immediate full independence. Considering their popularity, refusing would all but certainly trigger a war… but many agree that this is not the way to a peaceful resolution, and that $COUNTRY$ should never submit to such demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010024;The Sinn Féin Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010024;We will not be negotiated with at gunpoint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1010024;Grant them independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010025;With Ireland once again under our control, talks have begun in earnest to deal with the Irish situation once and for all… now on our terms, rather than on theirs. The suggestion is that Ireland remain an autonomous Dominion under our control, with any regions that wish to opt out of the new state and remain part of $COUNTRY$ able to do so. Others suggest this is unworkable, and we should either simply release them and keep them as allies or annex them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010030;An Anglo-Irish politician by the name of Charles Stewart Parnell has just been elected to Parliament. Some are describing him as a firebrand and nationalist agitator, while others suggest he’s a man of remarkable charisma and organizational talent-able to take on the entirety of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political system in order to push his Irish Home Rule agenda and succeed. It’s very possible that this man could single-handedly turn the tide of opinion on the subject of Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1010030;Keep him contained. We don’t want trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1010030;Encourage him. He’ll do good work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010031;With Charles Stewart Parnell putting forward his Home Rule agenda, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ have become increasingly concerned that they might end up in an independent Irish state-one dominated by Irish Catholics in Dublin. They have begun actively campaigning to ensure this doesn’t happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1010031;Yet more trouble in Ireland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010032;Charles Stewart Parnell has been successfully advancing his Home Rule Bill through Parliament, and while it is continually being held up by opposition from the Upper House, there is a sense that the man is managing to convince $COUNTRY_ADJ$ law-makers who-in the not-too-distant past-might have said that Home Rule was unthinkable. \n \n Now we must consider whether his vision will see the light of day: do we grant Ireland the status of an autonomous Dominion under our control, or put this aside and face renewed violence among the Irish? Either way, this man Parnell will not desist, and the question will keep coming before us even if we do not pass the Bill now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010032;Irish Home Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010033;The revelation that Charles Stewart Parnell has been involved with a married woman, one Catherine O’Shea, and indeed is responsible for her subsequent divorce, was the scandal that ended his political career and prevented him from pushing the Home Rule agenda. Without him, it appears unlikely that the Irish Republican movement will gain the political clout it requires to attempt another passing of the Home Rule Bill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1010033;Unfortunate. For the Irish, I mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010034;Enclosure is the legal process of enclosing a number of small landholdings to create one larger farm. Once enclosed, use of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be common land for communal use. This results in less land for the people to cultivate. This, coupled with overpopulation in Ireland, contributed much to poverty in the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1020000;Born in 1794, El Hadj Omar ibn Sa'id Tall is an Islamic scholar and a Tijani Sufi. He has become very popular among the Sunni people of West Africa, thanks to his position as the khalifa of the Tijaniyya sufi brotherhood and the authority that such a role gives. After many voyages, the most important of which is the Hajj to Mecca, and six years in Sokoto, he has decided to move to Futa Jallon and settle in Dinguiraye. Such a great figure will certainly increase our prestige, but some say that his fame might reveal dangerous for our monarchy…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1020001;After establishing himself in Dinguiraye, Omar Tall has started to advocate for a Jihad in West Africa, a great holy war to cleanse the region of pagans, lapsed Muslims and European intruders. But the biggest issue is that this conflict is meant to also overthrown us, as he says that we, and the chiefs in Futa Tooro, too, have not the moral and religious integrity that our role requires.

EVTDESC1100054;During the early years of the new Mexican republic there was widespread civil disorder as factions competed for control of the country.

In a complaint to the French $MONARCHTITLE$, a French pastry chef known only as Monsieur Remontel claimed that in 1832 Mexican officers looted his shop in Tacubaya. Other complaints from French nationals (among them the looting in 1828 of French shops at the Parian market and the execution in 1837 of a French citizen accused of piracy) culminated in $YEAR$ with prime minister Louis-Mathieu Molé recommending a demand from Mexico for the payment of 600,000 pesos (3 million Francs - 120,000¤) in damages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4660099;It is the will of the entrerriano people to resume the exercise of the powers inherent in its territorial sovereignty and currently delegated to His Excellency the Governor and Captain General of Buenos Aires, for the cultivation of external relations and general direction of peace and war of the Argentine Confederation, under the quadrilateral treaty of the coastal provinces dated January 4, 1831. \n Until now, the governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, had all the government power and exercised all external relations in the provinces of the Confederation. Each year Rosas presented his resignation, knowing it would be rejected. This statement consisted of Urquiza’s effective acceptance of the resignation of Rosas by the Province of Entre Rios, who was resuming its ability to conduct its trade and external relations with other nations until such constitution of a republic was formalized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC4999100;A moderate numbers of European immigrants settled in Chile during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, mainly Spanish, as well as German, British, French, Southern Slavs, and Italians who have made additional contributions to the racial complex of Chile. However, this immigration was never in a large scale, contrasting with mass migrations that characterized Argentina and Brazil, and therefore, anthropologically, its impact with lesser consequence.

The establishment of British colonies in Australia from 1788 and the boom in whaling and sealing in the Southern Ocean brought many Europeans to the vicinity of New Zealand, with some deciding to settle. Whalers and sealers were often itinerant and the first real settlers were missionaries and traders in the Bay of Islands area from 1809. By 1830 there was a population of about 800 non Maori which included a total of about 200 runaway convicts and seamen who often married into the Maori community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As the age of Imperialism begins and we look to expand our influence, the question is whether we should make a return to any of our former American colonies. Though reclaiming Haiti would be a bloody campaign, it is relatively defenceless and without allies. However, if we were to reclaim New France itself, we will certainly risk war with The United Kingdom, and will be guaranteed war with the United States. While we may be able to regain some land through negotiations, much of these lands must be regained via war, something that will cause much internal unrest and international tension.

While Napoleon Bonaparte would continue French conquests, His eventual defeat would lead France to be stripped of its new territory by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The prospect of reclaiming France’s natural borders, however, remained popular to many people both within the government and France itself.

EVTDESC7790011;In 1838 Jean François Langlois, commander of the whaling ship Cachalot, embarked on a grandiose scheme for a French colony at Akaroa. After a dubious land purchase from Maori he established the Nanto-Bordelaise Company in France to carry out the project, and in 1839, King Louis-Philippe agreed to provide assistance. The French representative for the settlement, Captain Charles François Lavaud, sailed for New Zealand in April 1840. A month later, the ship Comte de Paris set off for Akaroa carrying 53 emigrants. The French scheme sparked debate in England and France, and bowing to pressure to colonise the country, the British government sent out William Hobson in 1839.

EVTDESC7790100;With the Rhineland back under French control, the question has been raised as to what to do with the new ‘French’ subjects. Despite the German nature of the West Bank, The Rhinelanders had not been enemies of Revolutionary France, unlike the Spaniards or Portuguese. Prussia, even after their incorporation of the Rhineland and Westphalia in 1815, were regarded by the Rhinelanders with more suspicion, due to their Francophile feeling. The incorporation of such a large number of non-French citizens has also brought up France’s cultural diversity in other areas of the Empire, such as in Algeria or Flanders. Some of the more conservative politicians call for a purely French state, united in one language and culture. The Liberals, however, call for granting the Rhinelanders autonomy similar to that of the Walloons.
