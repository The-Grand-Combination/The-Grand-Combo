the_sublime_threshold_title;The Sublime Threshold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_sublime_threshold_desc;The Holiest cities of Shia Islam are -outside of Mecca and Medina- the shire cities of Iraq: Karbala and Najaf -containing the shires of Hussein and Ali respectively- and to a lesser extend Samarra and Baghdad. These cities are of great spiritual significance to our people, yet they remain subject to foreign domination. It would be a great coup if we could bring them under our total control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
second_treaty_of_erzurum_title;The Second Treaty of Erzurum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
second_treaty_of_erzurum_desc;While various treaties have demarked the Persian-Ottoman border, tension have remained high throughout history.

The Great Powers are fearful of this prospect and have offered to help us to demark the border and settle all remaining disputes for once and all. [Ottoman Empire looses all cores on all Persian owned provinces, Persia looses all cores on Ottoman owned provinces, should the other side accept.];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
per_expedition_to_europe_title;The Shah's Tour of Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
per_expedition_to_europe_desc;Our prime minster has steadily been trying reform and modernise Persia, but it has been slow going.

build_niavaran_title;Build Niavaran Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
build_niavaran_desc;The old imperial palaces of Persia all date to Qajar rule, and are statements to their reign. Both their splendor and their ultimate failures. As a new dynasty we need to dissassociate ourself with the previous dynasty and build our own palaces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bombard_the_majles_title;Bombard the Majles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bombard_the_majles_desc;The Majles (parliament) was established during the Constitutional Revolution to oversee government and limit the ability of the Shah to procure loans and sells concessions. It is hoped that by strictly controlling government finance the influence of foreign power is lessened.

reassert_kopet_dag_mountains_desc;The Turkmen tribes of the Kopet Dag mountains hold nominal allegiance to our throne but, recognising only clan and tribal authority, they are in effect beyond the pale of the state. This has allowed them to continue raiding Persian caravans and cities along the border, as well as enslaving those they capture. With the external and internal situation settling down, we should perhaps reaffirm our authority over the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_lengeh_title;Assert Dominance over Lengeh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_lengeh_desc;With the external and internal situation stabilised, it is time to turn to reasserting our authority over the peripheral regions. For too long have the Arab traders off the Gulf coast flaunted their independence. It is time to restore order and our prestige!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_bushehr_title;Assert Dominance over Bushire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_bushehr_desc;With the external and internal situation stabilised, it is time to turn to reasserting our authority over the peripheral regions. For too long have foreign powers controlled the strategic port of Bushere. It is time to restore order and our prestige!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_khorasan_title;Assert Dominance over Khorasan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

assert_khuzestan_title;Assert Dominance over Arabistan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_khuzestan_desc;The Arab tribes in Khuzestan have always been left to run their own affairs, as long as they acknowledge our suzerainty and pay the necessary taxes.

reclaim_abbas_title;Reclaim Bandar Abbas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reclaim_abbas_desc;The renewed treaty with Oman regarding the lease of Bandar Abbas not only is a lot more stringent, it also imposes a number of conditions under which the treaty becomes null and void and Bandar Abbas returns to us. For example: if the Sultan is disposed or fails to make the required payments. As it stand, we currently have sufficient reason to declare the treaty null and void and reclaim Bandar Abbas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
