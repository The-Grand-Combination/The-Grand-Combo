After Nat Turner was captured and the rebellion ended, over a hundred slaves were massacred in retaliation. For many in New Africa, Nat Turner represents the heroism and determination needed to fight such a brutal system like slavery.

EVTDESC44132230;Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings is a collection of African American folktales that author Joel Chandler Harris recalled from his childhood on his family’s plantation in Georgia. Although New Africa has since liberated Georgia, many Southern whites, like Harris, still hold on dearly to their memories during the time of slavery, and as such, Harris’s book has quickly become a best-seller and favourite among the white community in New Africa. However, the character of Uncle Remus has received a very mixed reaction from black New Africans. While it is impossible to ignore the rich collection of folklore Harris has been able to compile, there are many, especially among the intellectual class, who are critical of what they believe to be a romanticizing of slavery and accuse Harris of cultural theft.

EVTDESC81002216;In $YEAR$, the great powers of Europe assembled together on the initiative of $COUNTRY$ and decided the fate of Morocco and its sultan with the Tangier Protocol. It was decided that a 373-square-kilometre international, neutral and demilitarized zone centred on the city of Tangier was to be created. The sultan of Morocco was given sovereignty and jurisdiction over the native population. Thus, the great powers hoped that the current conflicts over Morocco would end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC81002217;In $YEAR$, the great powers of Europe assembled together to decide the fate of Morocco and its sultan with the Tangier Protocol. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government proposed the creation of a 373-square-kilometre international, neutral and demilitarized zone centred on the city of Tangier and temporal powers and jurisdiction of the natives to the Moroccan sultan. However, negotiations broke down and no consensus could be reached. There are doubts if the proposal was outright reject, if it couldn’t find enough supporters or if it was shelved but the fact remains that the Tangier Protocol is dead in the water, a great blow to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Days later, an opposing "German Committee" was formed, which was largely influenced by German public officials loyal to the Prussian King and disgruntled Jews expelled from the Polish Committee... Soon enough the breakdown of Prussian authority allowed long-simmering resentments to explode: Polish nobility and peasantry took up arms, preparing for confrontation with the Prussian Army which was sent to quell the protests, Prussian symbols were torn down, and in a couple of places, fighting erupted with German colonists all across the Grand Duchy.;;;;;;;;;x

The uprising was largely unsuccessful and led to an increased presence of Russian troops in Poland.
