EVTDESC31500001;Similarly, to guberniyas of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, the Baltic Governorates were not a subject to the common civil and administrative laws of the Russian Empire, but did not have monetary, fiscal and passport system of their own. Like guberniyas of the Kingdom of Poland they were treated as an integral entity and the Russian law provided them the preservation of local authorities. In the Baltics these were Landtags. The special legislation which set rules for municipal administration and entrepreneurship according to local traditions, as well as the privileges to the local nobility, usually German, in the Baltics was known under the collective name of Ostsee Right.

EVTDESC44132219;In 1831, Nat Turner led a slave rebellion in Virginia that was composed of more than 70 slaves and resulted in the death of 60 white people, including women and children. After Nat Turner was captured and the rebellion ended, over a hundred slaves were massacred in retaliation. For many in New Africa, Nat Turner represents the heroism and determination needed to fight such a brutal system like slavery. However, whites in the country perceive Nat Turner as a violent murderer. With the 100th Anniversary of the rebellion closely approaching, there is mounting pressure on the government on how to remember such a cataclysmic event and such a complicated man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA44132220;When New Africa was in vogue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132223;Soon after its establishment, the New African government founded the National Underground Railroad Institute. While its official public function is to assist with the settlement of escaped slaves into New Africa, the Institute, as suggested by its less than subtle name, secretly works with abolitionists to help slaves escape bondage from the American South and flee to New Africa. There are also rumours that the Institute funds and organizes slave revolts - however, the Institute denies such accusations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC44132225;New Africa is a nation of free people who once endured systematic violence and forced servitude.

EVTDESC44132228;A man of both African and Indian heritage, John Horse fought alongside Seminole tribes against the United States Army during the Second Seminole War.

After killing the ship’s captain, they seized control of the vessel. Although they were initially planning to sail for Nassau, they have instead arrived at a New African port. The most apparent course of action is to welcome Washington and the other slaves as heroes. However, doing so will undoubtedly enrage the United States, which would accuse New Africa of harbouring criminals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC44132230;Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings is a collection of African American folktales that author Joel Chandler Harris recalled from his childhood on his family’s plantation in Georgia. Although New Africa has since liberated Georgia, many Southern whites, like Harris, still hold on dearly to their memories during the time of slavery, and as such, Harris’s book has quickly become a best-seller and favourite among the white community in New Africa. However, the character of Uncle Remus has received a very mixed reaction from black New Africans. While it is impossible to ignore the rich collection of folklore Harris has been able to compile, there are many, especially among the intellectual class, who are critical of what they believe to be a romanticizing of slavery and accuse Harris of cultural theft. The New African government can either curtail the distribution of Harris’s work or allow it circulate openly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC44132231;Born into bondage in 1818, Fredrick Douglass escaped slavery at a young age and fled from Maryland to New Africa. He has quickly gained notoriety for his skill as an orator and controversy for his staunch support of racial and gender equality. While most in New Africa view him as the country’s most important statesman, few entirely embrace his radical proposal for the greater social and political integration of whites in New Africa. However, his most recent publication, A Narrative of New Africa, has enticed many New Africans into his Equality Party and led to an increased acceptance of the notion for greater equality among the races.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC44132232;The legend of John Henry is the tale of one man with raw strength and incredible endurance beating a steam-powered machine in a competition to drill a tunnel through a mountain. Although where precisely this competition occurred and whether if such a man even existed is debatable, there is no denying that John Henry has become an inspiring symbol of the industrial New African man. Additionally, his hammer-wielding image has become closely associated with socialist parties and trade unions, especially those composed of railway workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC44132233;Prominent academic and founder of the Tuskegee Institute Booker T. Washington has always been known as a moderate voice in New African politics, and he frequently opposes war waged at the expense of various domestic reforms, especially those related to education. Washington recently gave a speech to a large crowd in $CAPITAL$. In the speech, he called for the development of greater respect and the reduction of tensions between whites and blacks in New Africa. Furthermore, Washington argued for better relations between New Africa and the United States and proposed a compromise in which New Africa would cease territorial expansion into the American South in return for an increase in trade and protection from the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC81002213;At 11:40 p.m. an iceberg was spotted immediately ahead of the Titanic and the bridge was alerted. The First Officer ordered the ship to be steered around the obstacle and the engines to be put in reverse, but it was too late: the starboard side struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline. Five of the ship’s watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that the ship was doomed, as it could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. It began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as its angle in the water became steeper. Ships in $YEAR$ were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels so Titanic only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board. More than 1500 people died, the biggest toll in history. The disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC81002215;The Tangier Protocol, formally known as the Convention regarding the Organization of the Statute of the Tangier Zone, is a diplomatic proposal over the fate of Sultan of Morocco and Tangier brought forward by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government. The proposal is to create a 373-square-kilometre international zone centred on the city of Tangier, North Africa under the joint administration of the signatory countries, with the Sultan of Morocco retaining sovereignty over the zone and jurisdiction over the native population. Tangier is to be made a neutral demilitarized zone so it will solve disagreements between the great powers on who should control it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The sultan of Morocco was given sovereignty and jurisdiction over the native population. Thus, the great powers hoped that the current conflicts over Morocco would end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, negotiations broke down and no consensus could be reached.
