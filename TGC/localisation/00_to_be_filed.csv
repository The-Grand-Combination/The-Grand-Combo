the_sublime_threshold_title;The Sublime Threshold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_sublime_threshold_desc;The Holiest cities of Shia Islam are -outside of Mecca and Medina- the shire cities of Iraq: Karbala and Najaf -containing the shires of Hussein and Ali respectively- and to a lesser extend Samarra and Baghdad. These cities are of great spiritual significance to our people, yet they remain subject to foreign domination. It would be a great coup if we could bring them under our total control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
second_treaty_of_erzurum_title;The Second Treaty of Erzurum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
second_treaty_of_erzurum_desc;While various treaties have demarked the Persian-Ottoman border, tension have remained high throughout history. Today is no different, and various border incidents [of variable intensity] are threating to throw our empires into war. The Great Powers are fearful of this prospect and have offered to help us to demark the border and settle all remaining disputes for once and all. [Ottoman Empire looses all cores on all Persian owned provinces, Persia looses all cores on Ottoman owned provinces, should the other side accept.];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
per_expedition_to_europe_title;The Shah's Tour of Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
per_expedition_to_europe_desc;Our prime minster has steadily been trying reform and modernise Persia, but it has been slow going. He has suggested making a trip to Europe to witness first handed the progress being made there. He hopes that seeing it first handed will allow us to learn from Europe and implement the necessary reforms here in Persia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
recognize_afghanistan_title;Recognise the Kingdom of Afghanistan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
recognize_afghanistan_desc;The region currently occupied by Afghanistan had long been part of the territory ruled by the Persian dynasties. Only with the emergence of the Durrani dynasty has it become indepent. Still conflict lingers surrounding certain territories claimed by both sides. We are being pressured to finally recognise the borders as they exist today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
build_niavaran_title;Build Niavaran Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
build_niavaran_desc;The old imperial palaces of Persia all date to Qajar rule, and are statements to their reign. Both their splendor and their ultimate failures. As a new dynasty we need to dissassociate ourself with the previous dynasty and build our own palaces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bombard_the_majles_title;Bombard the Majles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bombard_the_majles_desc;The Majles (parliament) was established during the Constitutional Revolution to oversee government and limit the ability of the Shah to procure loans and sells concessions. It is hoped that by strictly controlling government finance the influence of foreign power is lessened. As such the Majles is a threat to both the authority of the Shah and the ability of foreigners to control Persian affairs. Perhaps we should 'reign it in.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_shahanshah_title;Become Shahanshah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_shahanshah_desc;The Shahanshah mean 'King of Kings' and is the ancient title used by the Persian emperors. We should adopt it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

reassert_kopet_dag_mountains_title;Assert Dominance over the Turkmen tribes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reassert_kopet_dag_mountains_desc;The Turkmen tribes of the Kopet Dag mountains hold nominal allegiance to our throne but, recognising only clan and tribal authority, they are in effect beyond the pale of the state. This has allowed them to continue raiding Persian caravans and cities along the border, as well as enslaving those they capture. With the external and internal situation settling down, we should perhaps reaffirm our authority over the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
treaty_of_akhal_title;Treaty of Akhal;;;;;;;;;;;;x
treaty_of_akhal_desc;Our designs for Turkestan are starting to come to fruition. However, Persia stubbornly holds on to ancient claims to the region. In their weakened state it seems unlikely that they'll be willing to risk upsetting us. Perhaps we can force them to relinquish all territories and claims on Turkestan?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_lengeh_title;Assert Dominance over Lengeh;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_lengeh_desc;With the external and internal situation stabilised, it is time to turn to reasserting our authority over the peripheral regions. For too long have the Arab traders off the Gulf coast flaunted their independence. It is time to restore order and our prestige!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_bushehr_title;Assert Dominance over Bushire;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_bushehr_desc;With the external and internal situation stabilised, it is time to turn to reasserting our authority over the peripheral regions. For too long have foreign powers controlled the strategic port of Bushere. It is time to restore order and our prestige!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_khorasan_title;Assert Dominance over Khorasan;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_khorasan_desc;Khorasan has always been a troublesome region with strong independent inclinations. As the nobility there cannot be trusted to support us, it might be necessary to establish more direct rule over the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_khuzestan_title;Assert Dominance over Arabistan;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assert_khuzestan_desc;The Arab tribes in Khuzestan have always been left to run their own affairs, as long as they acknowledge our suzerainty and pay the necessary taxes. However, to form a truly modern state, and reaffirm our position on the world stage, we need to end such backward practises and assert our authority in all our territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
renegotiate_abbas_lease_title;Renegotiate the Bandar Abbas Lease;;;;;;;;;;;;x
renegotiate_abbas_lease_desc;The wealthy port of Bandar Abbas is leased to the Omanis under unfavourable conditions. Any attempts to renegotiate the lease has been blocked on account of the strength of the Omani navy. The death of Sa'id bin Sultan Al-Busaid and the subsequent division of his sultanate has created an opportunity, however, as in this weakened state Muscat might be more willing to negotiate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reclaim_abbas_title;Reclaim Bandar Abbas;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reclaim_abbas_desc;The renewed treaty with Oman regarding the lease of Bandar Abbas not only is a lot more stringent, it also imposes a number of conditions under which the treaty becomes null and void and Bandar Abbas returns to us. For example: if the Sultan is disposed or fails to make the required payments. As it stand, we currently have sufficient reason to declare the treaty null and void and reclaim Bandar Abbas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
