EVTDESC152009872;There is unrest among $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officers in the military, enough that some of them are actively spreading dissension among the ranks. $COUNTRY$ would be better served, they say, if the army was in charge rather than the current leadership-elected it may be, but according to them it has proven too ineffective. And it seems many of the men under their command agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME152009872;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Coup?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA152009872;This could mean trouble down the line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC152009873;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ army forces in $CAPITAL$ have made their way toward the government buildings-not to protect the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as is their duty, but instead to oust our leaders and install themselves as $COUNTRY$’s new rulers. They claim that $COUNTRY$ is in a state of ‘upheaval’, and only the army can restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC152009874;Heavy street fighting erupts in the small streets of Paris as $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces advance into in a bid to capture the city. Artillery is moved to the Chaillot Hill, past improvised barriers while infantry run away from the 7th arrondissement and move systematically from house to house, block by block, fighting a running battle against armed irregulars. The Arc de Triomphe is demolished by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ pioneers while the artillery in Chaillot hill set their sights on the Eiffel Tower. For several minutes the city is taken by the roar of artillery until silence falls and the only sound is the screeching of retorted metal slowly bending. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers shout excitedly as they watch the Eiffel Tower bend and fall into the Seine, now reduced to an amorphous lump of metal. \n \n Fires rage out of control in the eastern parts of the city, lighting up the skyline as the fighting continues into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC152009875;Scattered gunfire can be heard echoing through the empty streets of London as the last pockets of resistance to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ occupation are quelled. The parliament houses in the Palace of Westminster lay empty while $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers run up and down placing explosives in the silent corridors. A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ general silently read the orders that came from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ capital with instructions to destroy the Palace in an attempt to crush the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ spirit. The explosives are detonated at the same time as the Clock Tower bell strike its precise hourly strike. The tower is engulfed by flames as parts of the western palace collapse, with pieces of the Big Ben landing on the Thames along with other debris while nearby buildings are hit by flaming debris and catch fire. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers watch and cherish from a safe distance as the glass that once contained the phrase ‘DOMINE SALVAM FAC REGINAM NOSTRAM VICTORIAM PRIMAM’ rains on the ground. Nearby, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers storm the Buckingham Palace just to find out that the $MONARCHTITLE$ has already fled the country. They hoist the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ flag and turn to see the smoke rising in the horizon. London is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190419121;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to sell the Fort Ross trading post to us! Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA190419121;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190419122;$MONARCHTITLE$, negotiations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ over Fort Ross have stalled, and they have declined to sell us the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC232000000;I saw, about four miles to the left, a sheet of water, which ultimately proved to be a creek and the southernmost part of what the Arabs call the Ukerewe Sea. Convinced that I finally found the source of the Nile, I went down a grassy and jungled depression into a deep, dirty, viscid nullah, which communicated with the southern end of the creek, which we named Jordan. As we followed the creek, that increased in breadth as it extended northwards, we saw many little islands in Ukerewe, well wooded, standing boldly out of the water. The journey continued through another tortuous day until we reached the village of Isamiro, where the view was clearer and better. In the distant horizon a calm sea line started to appear between north and west. Even in a well-known country the view would have attracted attention for its placid beauty, he thought to himself. He felt he had solved the great old riddle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME232000000;The Source of the Nile Discovered?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA232000000;We shall name it…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB232000000;Perhaps it should be called…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC232000000;Our $MONARCHTITLE$ would be satisfied with the name…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD232000000;This great body of water will be known as…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE232000000;We need a name worthy of its beauty…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC232000003;One of our explorers found a massive body of water in Africa, and he claims that it's the true source of the Nile! Upon preliminary reports, it seems that what was found is a huge lake that might as well be the source of the Nile. He insists we should call this discovery Lake Victoria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA232000003;Oh well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC370000002;The factories extend their flanks of fouler brick one after another, bare, with shutter-less windows, like economical and colossal prisons… and inside, lit by gas-jets and deafened by the uproar of their own labour, toil thousands of workmen, penned in, regimented, hands active, feet motionless, all day and every day, mechanically serving their machines…’ \n The hard work that the city’s workers perform has outraged many, and a committee has been formed to tackle the rough working conditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME370000002;Long Work Hours;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA370000002;We should consider legislation to change this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC888888007;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted our proposal. Their border with Russia has been adjusted and the treaty signed.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME888888009;The Amban's Demand;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC888888009;The Amban, our Imperial representative from Peking and effectively the governor of $COUNTRY$, has informed our government that $FROMCOUNTRY$ has concluded a treaty with Russia -- a treaty that includes portions of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory, with now must be handed over without comment.

EVT888888009OPTA;We have no choice but to comply.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME888888006;The Treaty of Chuguchak;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC888888006;A diplomat from Russia has arrived in $COUNTRY$ with an infuriating demand: they wish to readjust the borders on our northwestern frontier. They wish project their power in Central Asia, meaning all of the Yetisu would be turned over to them. Any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$-claimed territory would be handed over by us and our vassals. This is surely a wicked threat, capitalizing on our current perceived weakness. Accepting it will also mean any of our vassals in the region will have to be integrated back into our country, to avoid this situation in the future.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT888888006OPTA;We have no choice but to accept.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT888888006OPTB;Reject their outrageous demands.;;;;;;;;;;x
