1836_initial_setup_desc;A few changes that can only be made this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
1836_initial_setup_title;AI: 1836 Setup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_anarcho_liberals_desc;This tweak will stop anarcho-liberal ideology from spawning. It may help performance a bit. Some people think they are too unrealistic for them, so they might want to disable it. I didn’t test any balance issues that might arise without them in the game though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_anarcho_liberals_title;Option: Disable Anarcho-Liberal Ideology;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_assimilation_events_desc;Disables the immigration into province events such as Ethnic Flavour or Intermarriage as they can become spammy and not everyone likes them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_assimilation_events_title;Option: Disable Immigrant Assimilation Events;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_bankruptcy_events_desc;Disabling the Bankruptcy events will stop you from getting the CB and effects that happen when a country goes bankrupt on you. It won’t stop the event for the AI nor will it stop countries going bankrupt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_bankruptcy_events_title;Option: Disable Bankruptcy Events;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_colonial_railroading_desc;Within TGC are a number of flavour events and decisions which help both the AI and the player to follow a historical colonisation path in Africa and Asia. You may prefer to play without these leading to more unpredictable colonisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_colonial_railroading_title;Option: Disable Colonial Railroading;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_colonial_cassus_belli_africa_enabled_desc; This will enable you (and the AI) to justify protectorates/concessions on any province anywhere except China. By default, you can justify these CBs on bordering or port countries, while inland gets unlocked by Scramble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_colonial_cassus_belli_africa_enabled_title;Option: Enable Early Colonial CBs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_make_aiaustria_more_likely_to_join_desc;This is for players who want to see an almost certain mini-ww1 in 1853. By default, the chance Austria intervenes is 15%. This will make Austria almost certain to join the Crimean War. Which side you ask? Well, I guess you'll see. Prussia will react to either side Austria chooses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_make_aiaustria_more_likely_to_join_title;Make Austria Certain to join Crimean War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_commiemod_desc;The Commie Mod content is a bit volatile and buggy at the moment so it is disabled by default, if you desperately want to try it out you can enable it here. Bug reports about it are still welcome please just don't complain how it broke your game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_commiemod_title;Option: Enable Commie Mod;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_easter_eggs_desc;Easter Egg events are flavor events that don't impact the game in any real way but serve to just be something interesting to see in specific circumstances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_easter_eggs_title;Option: Disable Easter Eggs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_extra_flavour_desc;TGC has intergrated some ahistorical and wacky submods allowing players to take their nation down implausible alternative paths. You may prefer to play without these. (The AI will never take major ahistorical options regardless of this decision);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_extra_flavour_title;Option: Disable Extra Flavour;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_hpm_crisis_desc;In TGC, crises only start after 1870, when Revolution and Counter-revolution is researched and an event fires. This is to stop stuff like independent Ireland in 1840 because of the militancy that the famine generates, among other weird crises. Selecting this option will remove these restrictions and allow crises to happen from the start of the game, like it happens in vanilla Victoria 2.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_hpm_crisis_title;Option: Enable Crisis From The Start;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_microstates_desc;Activate this if you do not want the microstates of Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, Couto Misto, Mt. Athos,and Neutral Moresnet in the game. It removes their cores and annexes them to the nearest country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_microstates_title;Option: Disable Microstates;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_options_desc;This will hide all optional tweaks to vanilla TGC. You still have until 1837 to change your mind though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

option_disable_starting_party_loyalty_desc;This option will remove all starting party loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_starting_party_loyalty_title;Option: Remove Starting Party Loyalty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_uk_isolation_desc;Historically the UK did not ally major european powers, and so in TGC the UK is forced to break alliances with any Great Powers who aren't Portugal, Belgium, Japan or the Ottomans. You may wish to turn this off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_uk_isolation_title;Option: Disable Splendid Isolation For The UK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_unite_as_puppet_decisions_desc;This option will disable decisions which allow a Great Power to unite some of their spherelings into a culture union puppet (Italy, Iberia, Scandinavia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Arabia, Transcaucasia, Turkestan and the United Baltic Duchy) as some players consider these to be OP and prefer to play without them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_unite_as_puppet_decisions_title;Option: Disable 'Unite as Puppet' Decisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_leader_events_desc;Disable events for political leader modifiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_leader_events_title;Option: Disable Leader Events;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_trade_policy_desc;Disable Choose Trade Policy decisions for all countries (as opposed to choosing disable in the event which only disables them for you).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_trade_policy_title;Option: Disable Trade Policy decisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_workplace_events_desc;A few province events related to the workplace, such as ‘The Old Man and the Sea’, ‘All the Tea in PROVINCENAME’ and ‘Blood and Iron Mine’ can get quite spammy. I increased the MTTH and tried to balance it out, adding more requirements, but if you still find it spammy, you can use this option to completely disable them. Keep in mind that I didn’t test balance with these events disabled or anything like this, and this might help improve performance a little bit. A few events that only trigger because you have no or low workplace safety standards are still in though. Pass workplace reforms if you want to get rid of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_workplace_events_title;Option: Disable Workplace Events;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_disable_warship_commissions_desc;Disable the decisions to commission a warship from another country or take a warship commission from another country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

option_enable_lucky_nations_desc;Sometimes in this world, nations seem to be blessed by God in certain periods. Their leaders are brilliant, their people are hardy, they excel in warfare, produce amazing works of culture, and their economies boom. Do we live in such a world? If Lucky Nations are enabled ten random (non-great power) civilized nations and five random uncivilized nations will be given special powerful bonuses that will enable them to shake up the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
option_enable_lucky_nations_title;Option: Enable Lucky Nations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This, along with all decisions it enables, will disappear January 1st 1837 to reduce clutter, so you have a year in-game to pick and choose what you want. Once a tweak is chosen, you can’t disable it anymore, so if you mis-click you need to edit your save or start a new game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

override_policy_closed_border_desc;A closed border is a border that prevents movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no exceptions associated with this movement. These borders normally have fences or walls in which any gates or border crossings are closed and if these border gates are opened, they generally only allow movement of people in exceptional circumstances. In case of emigration as well as immigrations, departing ships are inspected for illegal emigrants. These controls and checks come at the cost of an increased demand from the State’s bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
override_policy_closed_border_title;Close the Borders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
override_policy_immigration_quota_desc;A conditionally open border is a border that allows movement of people across the border that meet a special set of conditions. This special set of conditions which limits the application of border controls that would normally otherwise apply could be defined by an international agreement or international law, or the special conditions could be defined by a regulation or law of the jurisdiction that the people are claiming the right to enter. Conditionally open borders generally requires a claim to be submitted from the people who are proposing to enter the new jurisdiction stating why they meet the special conditions which allow entry into the new jurisdiction. In the case of our country, quotas mean that no foreigners that fail a literacy test in their own language or are nationals of countries that were or are at war with our nation are allowed. These controls and checks come at the cost of an increased demand from the State’s bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
override_policy_immigration_quota_title;Implement Immigration Quotas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
override_policy_open_borders_desc;An open border is a border that enables free movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no restrictions on movement. A border may be an open border due to intentional legislation allowing free movement of people across the border, or a border may be an open border due to lack of adequate enforcement or adequate supervision of the border. One of the advantages of such a policy is that it requires little to none effort from the State’s bureaucracy to keep control over immigrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
override_policy_open_borders_title;Abolish Immigration Restrictions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
