EVTDESC300998;Baluchistan consists of numerous more or less independent tribes who are loosely confederated under one Great Khan. But even though the Baluchis have never accepted any central authority, we've always considered them to be part of our empire. Recent British efforst however have greatly increased their influence in the region.\n\nTo settle the matter as to whom Baluchistan belongs for once and all, an independent arbitration committee has been called. It has ruled that Kohistan belongs in the Persian sphere of influence, while the rest belongs to the British Raj. There are however some discrepencies how the border is to actually run. If we act quickly we might be able to take advantages of this.\n\n[You've gained a core in Bunpoor and Kussurkund.

EVTDESC301001;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s have reasserted their authority over the ports around Lengeh on the northern shore of the Persian Gulf. The ports de jure belonged to $FROMCOUNTRY$, but due to internal and external pressure $FROMCOUNTRY$ had been unable to assert their authority.

While the city was not official $COUNTRY_ADJ$, in light of our economic and diplomatic presence in the city and lack of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ authority, the general held opinion was that it might as well have been. Recent changes in the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ administration, however, has given them sufficient influence in the region to reassert their authority over the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301003;The Bandar Abbas Lease;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301003;We've been approached by a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy seeking to renegotiate our lease on the port of Bandar Abbas. It would seem that our recent troubles have emboldened the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s in their stance towards us. The renewed lease they are proposing would see more stringent conditions, a higher fee, the formal recognition of Persian sovereignty over the region[*] and a number cancellation clauses[**]\n\n[*]The recognition is only formal, you will not actually secede Bandar Abbas to $FROMCOUNTRY$\n[**]i.e. bankruptcy, rebellion, revolution and $FROMCOUNTRY$ reaching secondary power and Oman not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301007;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Grand Designs for Central Asia are starting to interfere with our just claims to the regions. Already the great Khanate of Khiva has been subdued, while it seems only a matter of time untill the other Khanates follow suit. All the while it seems exceedingly unlikely we will be able to turn this trend.\n\nA Russian diplomatic mission has arrived in $CAPITAL$ to discuss just this issue. They propose that, in the interest of avoiding unnecessary conflict, a clear border is defined. The border they are insisting on however would see us loose all our claims and territories in Turkestan. Accepting this proposal would go a long way to stabilise our relations and prevent future conflict. Relinquishing our ancient claims would however also be greatly humiliating and very unpopular at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301008;In their infinite wisdom, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s have agreed to our proposal and will evacuate all territories in Turkestan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301009;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s seem to understand that resisting our Designs for Central Asia is pointless, and have agreed to withdraw to south of the Atreck River.

However word has now reached us from Bombay that the British are refusing to fulfil the terms of the agreement, claiming that, as both the resident of Bushire and the governor of Shiraz exceeded their authority, the treaty of null and void. Without British approval or support, taking Bahrain might prove costly. However, this treaty might prove useful in the future to support our claim to Bahrain.\nHow shall we proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301016;A clandestine treaty was signed recently between the British resident in Bushere and the Persian governor of Shiraz which obligated the British to help the Persians conquer us!

EVTDESC301040;The nature of the Ottoman border has always led it to be a source of friction between our empires. While officially the border was demarked by the Treaty of Zuhab, the tribes on both sides of the border have little regard for this border. They regularly migrate across it, and play governors off eachother to assert their independence.\nTensions have now reached a boiling point: A high ranking Turkish officer from Baghdad, who had sought refugee at our court, was, together with some of our officers, kidnapped and beheaded by the Ottomans. While at the same time the governor of Van has been instigating rebellion among the Azeri tribes along the border. Lastly, we should not forget the Wahabis raiding our pilgrims to Mecca and Karbala, something the Ottomans are not combatting and sometimes engaging in themselves.\nShould we decided to press the issue, the Russian Tsar has promised his support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301053;'Caucasus! Bow down your snowy head.\nSubmit! Yermolov Marches!' - Pushkin\n\nThe Treaty of Gulistan was supposed to end the struggle over the Caucasus between the Russian Empire and us. However tensions remain high as ever, and peace is bought at a bloody price as Russian Viceroy Yermolov employs a reign of terror to subdue the Caucasian tribes. Yet that is not the only source of tension: Yermolov accusses us of not fulfilling the territorial clauses of the Treaty, claiming Kapan belongs to Russia. Of course, it does not, but he has occupied the northern shore of lake Gokcha -a position from where he can threaten Erivan- to force us to the negotation table. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301054; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301054;The Treaty of Gulistan was supposed to settle the conflict over the Caucasus between us and the Persians, and bring peace and stability to the region. Yet everyday new reports of uprising, massacres and general nastiness come in. Unfortunately we must conclude that the Persians have failed to abide by the treaty, and we suspect they actively support the rebels.\nBy pressuring the Persians governor Yermolov has managed to abide by at least one article of the treaty: The Persians have evacuated the region around Kapan and seceded control to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

Yet everyday new reports of uprising, massacres and general nastiness come in. Unfortunately we must conclude that the Persians have failed to abide by the treaty, and we suspect they actively support the rebels.\nUnder the Treaty of Gulistan the region around Kapan was to be seceded to us by the Persians, yet nothing could motivate the Persians to evacuate the region. In a bold move, the governor of Tiflis Yermolov has now seized the northern shore of Lake Gokcha [Gyumri] as just compensation for the territory we lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC301057;The regular council at Sultanieh -the Shah's summer residence- is promising to turn into a historic gathering this year. Yermolov, claiming we have failed in our obligation to evacuate Kapan, continues to press our northern border. Now he has seized control over more territory around Lake Gokcha, and is now in a position to directly threaten Erivan. Yet this aggressive action belies the truth of the Russian's situation: Their empire is at the verge of civil war, with Russian princes are at eachother's throat, fighting for the throne. There are those who say the time to strike Russians is now: To avenge the continued humilation the Russians subject us too and liberate our Muslim brethren from Yermolov's oppression! Yet there are also those who argue caution, that the Russians are not to be underestimated, and that we should seek an accomodation with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301058;Dispatches from the Caucasus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301058;The regular council at Sultanieh -the Shah's summer residence- is rapidly turning into a momentous occassion. The Russians have pressed their claim and assumed control over the Kapan region. Yet this aggressive action belies the truth of the Russian situation: Their empire is at the verge of civil war, with Russian princes are at eachother's throat, fighting for the throne. There are those who say the time to strike the Russians is now: To avenge the continued humilation the Russians subject us too and liberate our Muslim brethren from Yermolov's oppression! Yet there are also those who argue caution, that the Russians are not to be underestimated, and that as such we should seek an accomodation with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301059; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301059;The Council of Sultanieh -the yearly army army review and the opportunity to pay homage to the Persian Shah- was quite an eventful occassion this year. Wild voices were pushing for war, to restore the Persian Empire in the Caucasus and, by radical fanatics -the ulama- in specific, to avenge the 'atrocities' commit against the peoples of the Caucasus. Yet we also had allies at court arguing for restraint and the futility of war against us. In the end, however, the deciding voice was our emissary who mananged to covince the Shah that there was no ill will on our part. His audience with the Shah was even so successful, that the Shah has resorted to settling some minor border disputes around $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301060;No Peace, No War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301060;Yermolov is making outrages accusation to our adress: He purported to have intercepted a caravan leaving Erivan carrying silver and arms for the Caucasians fighting their Russian oppressors. He claims that these actions were directed by Abbas Mirza under a policy of 'no peace, no war', which aims to strengthen Mirza's position as crown prince by stirring up trouble for the Russians in the Caucasus. Yermolov is demanding the right to build military posts on the road from Tabriz to Erivan to intercept future shipments of arms destined for the rebels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301061; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301061;Long have we suspected the court of Tabriz of stirring up trouble in the Caucasus under a policy of 'no peace, no war' in order to strengthen Abbas Mirza's claim to the Persian throne. And recently we finally found the evidence we need: A caravan leaving from Erivan carrying Persian silver and arms destined for the Caucasian rebels. Viceroy Yermolov has now moved to quickly block the road from Tabriz to prevent future shipments!\n[You gained Nakhichevan];;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301062;The Khanate of Erivan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301062;Yermolov has used his positions in Nakhichevan to close off all lines of communication between Tabriz and Erivan. It is now effectively cut off from our empire! As for the motivation for Yermolov to do so? We can only guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301063;Despite out best efforts to find an amicable settlement in the Caucasus, the Persians persist in trying to undermine our position there. Even more evidence has emerged detailing the involvement of Tabriz and Erivan in the war. As a result, Viceroy Yermolov has now blockaded Erivan to force them into submission, and end their support for the rebels. The Shah has made it known to us that he had no knowledge of the involvement of Erivan in the affair, and leaves it to us how to settle the matter with the court of Erivan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301070;The Treaty of Turkmenchay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

Erivan itself was a thorn in the Russian side, as it served to supply the rebels in the Caucasus. Under the spectre of war, however, the Russians managed to force the Persians to hand over the khanate to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNEWS301070_short;The Russian envoy looked terribly pleased as the Persian attempt to restore their rule over the Caucasus resulted in them losing their last footholds in the region to Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNEWS301070_medium;The Persian attempts to dislodge the Russians from the Caucasus and restore their rule over the region have ended in absolute failure. Under the humiliating terms of the peace treaty they have been forced to surrender their last footholds in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNEWS301070_long;Although few would have given the Persians a fighting chance against the Russian Empire, the totality of the Persian defeat came as a shock to all.

EVTNEWS301071_medium;Somewhere in this world a mad man bet on the impossible: A Persian victory over the Russians in their war over Caucasus! Yet it did happen, and this man must have made a fortune! We wonder if the war was fought honestly though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNEWS301071_long;In a series of events long held to be impossible, the Persians have managed to overcome the Russians in their war over the Caucasus.

The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ certainly haven't, and are out for vengence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
