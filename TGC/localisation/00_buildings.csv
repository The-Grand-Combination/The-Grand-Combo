aeroplane_factory;Aircraft Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aeroplane_factory_desc;Most aircraft in the era are constructed from wood, using metal sockets to joint members, and making use of piano wire or stranded steel cable for bracing. Wooden construction typically involved several different types of timber, with careful use of different woods according to their mechanical properties and they were typically covered in a variety of fabrics including rubberized cotton and varnished silk. The first engine design to be widely used for powering aircraft was the Antoinette water-cooled V-8 engine, believed to be the very first V-form eight-cylinder internal combustion engine ever placed in production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ammunition_factory;Ammunition Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ammunition_factory_desc;Swaging, rather than casting, was the preferred manufacturing technique during the 19th century for ammunition. Swaged bullets are bullets manufactured by swaging room temperature metals into a die to form it into the shape of a bullet. The other common manufacturing method is casting, which uses molten metals poured into a mould. Disadvantages became evident as loadings shifted to smokeless powder in the late 19th century and manufacturers of high-velocity military ammunition modified their bullet swaging process to apply a thin sheet of stronger metal over the soft lead bullet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
artillery_factory;Heavy Armament Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
artillery_factory_desc;The first stage of artillery production is to create an exact model of the gun, mortar, or howitzer. This is built up upon a tapered wooden spindle, from eight to 12 feet in length and about two inches less than the model in diameter. The spindle is then set upon a wooden turning frame and covered with grease or soap to aid in its eventual removal from the mould. A coat of a lye mixture is spread over the interior surface to prevent the molten metal of the casting adhering to the walls of the mould. The mould is then taken to the casting pit to be annealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
automobile_factory;Automotive Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
automobile_factory_desc;Early automobiles, known as ‘Horseless Carriages’, were simple vehicles with two or four stroke combustion engines capable of 2/3 horsepower (0.50 kW) at 250 rpm. Featuring an open crankcase and the use of a pushrod-operated poppet valve for exhaust, a large horizontal flywheel that stabilized the single-cylinder engine’s power output and an evaporative carburettor controlled by a sleeve valve to regulate power and engine speed. They were produced in small workshops but evolved fast, with the simple open metal frame soon giving way to chassis with glass windows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
barrel_factory;Tank Industry;Usine de chars;Geschützrohrfabrik;;;;;;;;;;;x
barrel_factory_desc;The tank is the 20th century realization of an ancient concept: that of providing troops with mobile protection and firepower and it was born of the need to break the domination of trenches, barbed wire, and machine guns over the battlefields. The internal combustion engine, armour plate, and the continuous track were key innovations leading to the invention of the modern tank. One of the earliest used designs was a rhomboid vehicle with a low canter of gravity and long track length, able to negotiate broken ground and cross trenches while the main armament was carried in sponsons on the hull sides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
canned_food_factory;Canning Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
canned_food_factory_desc;The canning concept is based on experimental food preservation work in glass containers by the French inventor Nicolas Appert. The fabrication of most cans results in at least one ‘rim’, a narrow ring whose outside diameter is slightly larger than that of the rest of the can. The flat surfaces of rimmed cans are recessed from the edge of any rim (toward the middle of the can) by about the width of the rim: the inside diameter of a rim, adjacent to this recessed surface, is slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the rest of the can. Canned food is mainly used for military rations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cement_factory;Cement Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cement_factory_desc;In 1824 Joseph Aspdin, a British bricklayer turned builder, patented a chemical process for making Portland cement which was an important advance in the building trades. This process involves sintering a mixture of clay and limestone to about 1400 °C (2552 °F), then grinding it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand, and gravel to produce concrete. Concrete is used to build factories, forts, shipyards, buildings, sewage systems and tunnels. Its use quickly became widespread in civil and military construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clipper_shipyard;Clipper Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clipper_shipyard_desc;Clippers are fast vessels with three masts and a square rig. They are generally narrow for their length, can carry limited bulk freight and have a large total sail area. Optimized for speed, they are too fine-lined to carry much cargo. Clippers typically carry extra sails such as skysails and moonrakers on the masts and studdingsails on booms extending out from the hull or yards, which required extra hands to handle them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dye_factory;Synthetic Dye Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dye_factory_desc;Natural dye is only present in small amounts and its extraction is often inefficient, so they are usually expensive. In an experiment with a compound called aniline, one of the simplest chemical components of coal tar, one inventor discovered that an alcohol extracted purple colour, which readily dyed silk, and was much more stable in sunlight than any other purple dye in use. In the Synthetic Dyeworks dyes are mixed, synthesized in a reactor, filtered for impurities, dried out and then blended. Along the way many other additives, solvents and chemical compounds are used to instigate reactions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
electric_gear_factory;Electric Parts Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
electric_gear_factory_desc;The age of electricity began in 1882 when Thomas A. Edison introduced a system of electric lighting in New York City. Electric lighting quickly spread across the United States and was soon adopted in Europe. The electrical components industry was born, producing a variety of electric components for cars, telephones, gramophones, and industrial machinery in general as the electrification in the industry advanced. Electric gears are needed for a variety of things, among them automobiles, telephones, radios, and aeroplanes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
explosives_factory;Chemical Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
explosives_factory_desc;The chemical factory manufactures a variety of components for industrial and military use like nitroglycerin, dynamite and black powder. In the early 19th century black powder was the main fabricated component, used to mine for minerals, break rocks, clear fields, and make roads. With the invention of dynamite, mines could be dug deeper and more quickly, and uneconomical deposits thus became profitable. Still, the main use of explosives was in the military industry: bombs, gunpowder, ordnances. For infantry, artillery or sappers, the use of explosives and gunpowder was central in the army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fabric_factory;Textile Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fabric_factory_desc;Fabric is a tightly woven textile made in a textile mill which is, among other things, used to produce sails for ships as well as clothing. With the Cartwright Loom, the Spinning Mule and the Boulton & Watt steam engine, the pieces were in place to build a mechanized textile industry. From this point there were no new inventions, but a continuous improvement in technology as the mill-owner strove to reduce cost and improve quality. Developments in the transport infrastructure facilitated the import of raw materials and export of finished cloth, diminishing costs and increasing profits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fertilizer_factory;Fertilizer Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fertilizer_factory_desc;In this factory fertilizer is created out of guano, sulphur, or bone meal. The most common way to create fertilizer is the Birkeland-Eyde process. This process was used to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into nitric acid (HNO3), one of several chemical processes generally referred to as nitrogen fixation. The resultant nitric acid was then used as a source of nitrate (NO3-) for the fertilizers. These fertilizers are used to increase the productivity of farms or the chemical components are further refined to make explosives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fuel_refinery_desc;An oil refinery is an industrial process plant where crude oil is processed and refined into more useful products such as petroleum naphtha, gasoline, diesel fuel, asphalt base, heating oil, kerosene, and liquefied petroleum gas. In the Refinery, crude oil is separated into fractions by fractional distillation. The fractions at the top of the fractionating column have lower boiling points than the fractions at the bottom. The heavy bottom fractions are often cracked into lighter, more useful products. All of the fractions are processed further in other refining units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
furniture_factory;Furniture Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
furniture_factory_desc;Well-off pops live in very comfortable houses, although their servants lived in cramped quarters, often in the attic. During the 19th century, for the first time in history furniture was mass-produced. That meant it was cheaper but unfortunately standards of design fell. In the early 19th century skilled workers usually lived in ‘through houses’ i.e. ones that were not joined to the backs of other houses while the general populace often lived in ‘back-to-backs’. These were houses of three (or sometimes only two) rooms, one of top of the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
glass_factory;Glass Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
glass_factory_desc;A new method of producing glass, known as the cylinder process, was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832, this process was used by the Chance Brothers to create sheet glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. The other glass-making method is glassblowing which produces bottles and other containers. Glass is used for a variety of appliances like bottles, windows, bowls, vases, lamps, jars, vacuum tubes, and light bulbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
liquor_distillery;Beverages Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
liquor_distillery_desc;The continuous still allowed the alcohol industry to reach new levels of productivity. The still consists of a first column (called the analyser) in a column still that has steam rising and wash descending through several levels. The second column (called the rectifier) carries the alcohol from the wash, where it circulates until it can condense at the required strength. It behaves like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. The tube is filled with either porous packing or bubble plates. The rising vapor, starts to condense in the cooler, higher level of the column.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lumber_mill;Lumber Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lumber_mill_desc;At the sawmill, the logs are cut into boards using equipment such as circular saws and bandsaws. This is called conversion. The first stage of conversion is a process called breaking down, which means rough sawing. The second stage is called resawing and refers to more accurate / precise cutting and finishing, such as planing and further machining. The introduction of steam power in the 19th century created many new possibilities for mills, with steam powered sawmills being far more mechanized and scrap lumber from the mill providing a ready fuel source for firing the boiler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
luxury_clothes_factory;Luxury Clothes Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
luxury_clothes_factory_desc;Garments made of a single piece of the finest silk, its unique colour acquired by repeated immersions in dyes whose shades were suggestive of moonlight or of the watery reflections of the Venetian lagoons, clothing embroiled with gold threads, handmade printed silk square scarves. The curvaceous S-Bend silhouette dominated fashion for women, the corset tightly laced at the waist which forced the hips back. Men wore tight-fitting, calf length frock coats and a waistcoat or vest. The vests were single-or double-breasted, with shawl or notched collars and accompanied by a crane or a hat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
luxury_furniture_factory;Luxury Furniture Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
luxury_furniture_factory_desc;Dark or gilded carved wood and richly patterned fabrics, intricate gold ornaments, cushions and fabric made out of silk, the finest or most exotic wood in the world used in furniture. Luxury furniture designers use and modify many styles taken from various time periods in history like Gothic, Tudor, Elizabethan, English Rococo, Neoclassical, and others. The Gothic and Rococo revival style are the most common styles to be seen in furniture during this time in history. Styles are mixed with the introduction of middle east and Asian influences in furniture, fittings, and interior decoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
machine_parts_factory;Machinery Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
machine_parts_factory_desc;The Industrial Revolution received a further boost with the popularization of railways. For the machinery industry this brought all sorts of new work with new machinery for metallurgy, machine tools for metalworking and production of steam engines for trains. In addition, the emerging machine factories started making machines for production machines as textile machinery, compressors, agricultural machinery, and engines for ships. In time the market for the machine industry became wider, specialized products were manufactured for a greater national and often international market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

paper_mill;Paper Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paper_mill_desc;The paper mill uses a Fourdrinier machine to make paper from vegetable fibres such as wood pulp. The machine is composed of a conveyor belt woven from bronze in the forming section, where a slurry of fibre (usually wood or other vegetable fibres) is drained to create a continuous paper web. After the forming section the wet web passes through a horizontal drainage area, referred to as the drainage table, thus creating a continuous production of Paper. Paper is used for books, newspapers, and other means of information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pharmaceuticals_factory;Pharmaceutical Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pharmaceuticals_factory_desc;Within the realm of pharmaceuticals, initial discovery involved meticulous exploration of chemical compounds and biological entities, often through in vitro and in vivo testing. Preclinical trials gauged safety and efficacy before advancing to the clinical phase. Manufacturing pharmaceuticals demanded adherence to exacting quality control standards. Active pharmaceutical ingredients were synthesized through chemical processes, fermentation, or biotechnological means. Formulation into tablets, capsules, injectables, and liquids occurred in specialized pharmaceutical plants, ensuring precise dosing and consistency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plastics_factory;Synthetic Polymers Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plastics_factory_desc;Starting with polymer production, raw materials such as petroleum, natural gas, and plant-based sources are converted into monomers through refining and chemical processes. These monomers are then polymerized to create polymers like polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and more. Next comes plastic processing, where polymers are transformed into usable products. Techniques include injection molding, extrusion, blow molding, and thermoforming. Injection molding, for example, produces intricate and precise components by injecting molten plastic into a mold cavity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
radio_factory;Radio Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
radio_factory_desc;AM radio uses amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the transmitted signal is made proportional to the sound amplitude captured (transduced) by the microphone, while the transmitted frequency remains unchanged. It can be a TRF receiver or a super heterodyne receiver, the latter typically using 6 triodes: a mixer, local oscillator, two IF and two audio amplifier stages, with an IF of 45 kHz. The radio case could be made of Bakelite or wood and the insides typically were made out of a variety of metals and vacuum tubes, with the occasional rubber to isolate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

regular_clothes_factory;Clothing Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
regular_clothes_factory_desc;During the industrial revolution, fabric production was mechanized with machines powered by waterwheels and steam-engines. Production shifted from small cottage-based production to mass production based on assembly line organization, with the sewing machine revolutionized clothes productions. The original machine was made of wood and uses a barbed needle which passes downward through the cloth to grab the thread and pull it up to form a loop to be locked by the next loop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tires_factory;Rubber Goods Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tires_factory_desc;Starting with compounding, raw rubber combines with additives like plasticizers, accelerators, and fillers. This blending process, using high-powered mixing equipment, imparts physical and chemical traits to the rubber. For example, fillers bolster strength, while accelerators aid vulcanization. Post-compounding, shaping techniques come into play. Extrusion forms uniform cross-sectional profiles like hoses, while compression or injection molding crafts intricate shapes like auto parts. Heat and pressure are applied during these processes to achieve the desired form.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
small_arms_factory;Small-Arms Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
small_arms_factory_desc;The basic equipment of the military, encompassing small arms such as muskets, rifled muskets, pistols, revolvers, and rifles. Rifled muskets, the most common firearm in the mid-19th century was wrought in iron, forged as one piece, annealed, and machined to the configuration of a threaded plug extending from one leg of an L-shaped tang. It was carburized for wear resistance, and finished in wood in the stock and barrel bands. Some of them were rifled while old musket models weren’t, and they typically came with a bayonet and a ramrod.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
soap_factory;Soap Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
soap_factory_desc;In its initial stages, soap-making centered on saponification, a basic chemical process. Fats or oils, sourced from animals or plants, were mixed with alkalis obtained from wood ashes. This mixture underwent heating in large kettles, initiating the reaction yielding soap and glycerin. Subsequently, the soap mixture was cooled, cut into bars, and left to air-dry and cure over several weeks. As the industry advanced, manufacturers diversified their choice of fats and oils, refining formulations to achieve desired characteristics. This allowed specialized soaps tailored for specific purposes - be it laundry, personal care, or industrial use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steamer_shipyard;Steamer Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steamer_shipyard_desc;The key innovation that made steamers viable is the change from the paddle-wheel to the screw-propeller for propulsion. Steam engines are designed with the power delivered at the bottom of the machinery, to give direct drive to the propeller shaft, where it passes to the stern tube through the hull. Since the motive power of screw propulsion is delivered along the shaft, a thrust bearing is needed to transfer that load without excessive friction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steel_factory;Alloys Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steel_factory_desc;Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, used in construction and other applications. When iron is smelted from its ore it contains more carbon than is desirable. To become steel, it must be reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct amount, at which point other elements can be added. Steel mills cast the raw iron into ingots which are stored until further refinement processes. The steel ingots are then heated in a soaking pit and hot rolled into slabs, blooms, or billets. Those are rolled into sheet metal, plates, bars, rods, wires, and structural steel, such as I-beams and rails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
synthetic_oil_factory;Coal Liquefaction Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
synthetic_oil_factory_desc;The main methods of direct conversion of coal to liquids by hydrogenation process is the Bergius process. In this process, the coal is finely ground and dried in a stream of hot gas. The dry product is mixed with heavy oil recycled from the process and a catalyst is typically added to the mixture. Usually, iron sulphides present in the coal may have sufficient catalytic activity for the process. The mixture is then pumped into a reactor and the reaction occurs between 400 to 500 °C and 20 to 70 MPa hydrogen pressure. The reaction produces heavy oils, middle oils, gasoline, and gases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
synthetic_sulphur_factory;Nitrate Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
synthetic_sulphur_factory_desc;Ammonia was first manufactured using the Haber process on an industrial scale in 1913 in BASF’s Oppau plant in Germany, reaching 20 tonnes per day the following year. During World War I, the production of munitions required large amounts of nitrate. The Allies had access to large sodium nitrate deposits in Chile controlled by British companies. Germany had no such resources, so the Haber process proved essential to the German war effort. Synthetic ammonia from the Haber process was used for the production of nitric acid, a precursor to the nitrates used in explosives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
telephone_factory;Telecommunication Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
telephone_factory_desc;The earliest telephones had only one wire for both transmitting and receiving of audio, but the design was quickly replaced by the candlestick telephone. It featured a base with a vertical cylindrical neck extending upright for up to 10 inches in length. At the top of the stand was mounted a carbon microphone (transmitter) to speak into, and a switch hook extending sideways upon which an ear piece (receiver) was hung. In order to make or answer a telephone call, the user lifted the receiver off the switch hook, thereby activating an internal switch connecting the telephone to the telephone line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
winery;Wine Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
winery_desc;The wine-making process involves the fermentation of fruit, with natural yeast or not, as well as blending. The malolactic conversion happens after, which is a bacterial process which converts ‘crisp, green apple’ malic acid to ‘soft, creamy’ lactic acid softening the taste of the wine. The wine is sometimes transferred to oak barrels to mature for a period of weeks or months. The wine must be settled or clarified and adjustments made prior to bottling. The process produces wastewater, pomace, and lees that require collection, treatment, and disposal or beneficial use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
