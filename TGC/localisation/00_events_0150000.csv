EVTDESC160001;We are receiving disturbing reports of anarchy in southern China. A peasant army led by the rebels Feng Yunshan and Wei Changhui has declared the ascendancy of the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’ and driven out local governors. All within the Qing government agree that we cannot recognize these rebels as having credence-if we do, it raises the question of whether the Mandate of Heaven is still held by the Imperial throne. That cannot be allowed, and thus the governors must be given the opportunity to crush the rebels and restore order in the Emperor’s name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160001;Anarchy in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160001;Crush them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB160001;Out with the Manchu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160002;We have crushed the ‘Heavenly Kingdom’, and proven to all of China that the Qing Dynasty yet maintains the Mandate of Heaven. We will abide no more insurrections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA160002;Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160003;Even though we are not yet done with the ‘Heavenly Kingdom’, the fact the rebels have forced us to a ceasefire and have not been crushed is being taken by our Chinese subjects as a sign of weakness. Officials are predicting rebellions in many other places in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160003;Truce With the Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160003;Unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160004;Though we are not yet done battling the hated Manchu, for the moment the Heavenly Kingdom claims victory. We have forced a truce, and now the Manchu will need to deal with rebellions across their land as the people realize their mandate to rule no longer exists. All the world watches us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160004;Truce With the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160004;Hooray!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160006;The continued existence of the Taiping rebels is an embarrassment to the Qing government and our Emperor. Calls have been made for the war to resume, and this time for a national effort be started to draft men into the Qing army.

EVTNAME160008;The Taiping Are Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160009;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160009;The Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160011;Due to the low value assigned to the birth of daughters, female infanticide has become wide-spread across much of China. The practice has become so common, in fact, it has led to a shortage of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC160012;We have received reports of Christian missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’. Their actions would not be so objectionable if they were not also preaching sedition against the Manchu-and, far worse, though provincial governors have attempted to halt the missionaries this has only seemed to stir up support for them even further. There are sightings of their pamphlets all over $STATENAME$ now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA160012;Collect the pamphlets and silence these missionaries-now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB160012;We shall tolerate this, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160013;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south.

EVTOPTA160013;This cannot be tolerated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160015;The man behind the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has been given a name: Hong Xiuquan. A former farmer who attempted the civil service examinations in Guangzhou and failed, he has now become a charismatic visionary taking advantage of anti-Manchu sentiment in the south. Some say he is crazed and mad, but regardless he is a danger to the Qing Dynasty and his words are finding eager ears.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160015;Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160015;He is of no consequence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160016;Reports have arrived at the palace that a firewood seller by the name of Yang Xiuqing has taken to walking the South lands, claiming to speak with the voice of God. Regardless of his seeming madness, the man has proven very effective at spreading the word of the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160016;Yang Xiuqing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160017;Followers of the ‘Heavenly Kingdom’ are causing further problems in the south.

EVTOPTA160017;This is starting to be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160020;The followers of the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’ have spread their influence even further. According to officials in $STATENAME$, the Christian rebels have been spotted in $PROVINCENAME$ and sentiment against the Qing Dynasty is on the rise throughout the entire state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160020;The Taiping Sect Spreads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160020;Hmm, that’s worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160025;Our beloved leader, the glorious and most holy Hong Xiuquan, has passed away-ascended into Heaven to receive his just rewards from God. Those of us who remain must now look to what will become of the Heavenly Kingdom without his guidance. There are some who say that his son, Hong Tianguifu, should be given the reins of power. Others say that Hong Tianguifu is a buffoon and that a republic is the way forward. Finally, a proper theocracy, without a hereditary rule, is another option that is considered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160025;The Death of Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC160026;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Formosa. The suggestion among what little remains of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taibei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA160026;It seems we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC164506;Water might float a boat, but it can also make it sink.’\n Chinese proverb\n \n The Huang He [Yellow River] is the great river on which our empire-or indeed our civilisation-has been build, sustaining the fields of the millions living within its course and China as a whole. Yet, like the god Hebo, the river is unpredictable and greedy, taking from those whom it uplifts and nourishes. A mighty system of dykes has been built along the river to channel and tame it, and protect those living along it-and China as a whole-from its greed. Sometimes though, it still lashes out and inflicts ruin on all those along its path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME164506;The Huang He Floods of $YEAR$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164507;Despite all it brings to China, the Huang He river has also been called the Scourge of the Sons of Han, and with good reason: Throughout history it has flooded numerous times and inflicted unimaginable suffering on our people. Only a few years ago the river lashed out and killed hundreds of thousands, an event we are still recovering from. Few could have predicted the river to be so vicious and return so soon, yet it has. The Huang He has burst its dykes again, flooding the country side and shifting the river hundreds of kilometres to the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME164507;China’s Sorrow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC164599;The forces of revolution have turned against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Emperor. With dissent threatening to spread into chaos, leaders of the Beiyang army have demanded the Emperor abdicate his throne. Cheering crowds in $CAPITAL$ greeted the news, but few are aware of the forces now lining up to take control of the government. Kuomintang revolutionaries have demanded a transformation of $COUNTRY$ into a republic with free elections.

EVTDESC164600;Revolutionary societies are springing up all over China, and recently we have received word that several of these societies have banded together as the Tongmenghui or ‘Chinese United League’. Their stated goal is the revival of Zhonghua, or the concept that China should be a nation ruled by a republic that represents all of its various peoples. These revolutionaries wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed of foreigner influence, and do not seem satisfied to wait and see what reforms the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy will provide. What’s more worrying is that some of the regional warlords appear to be assisting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC164601;Revolutionaries seeking to bring down the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy have been stirring up a revolt in $STATENAME$.

EVTDESC167000;Beginning with the Peasant’s Revolt of 1834 in Palestine, Druze nobles resented oversight. Their overlords considered them heretics and treated them as such. In the years following the Peasant’s Revolt, conscription was required in order to reinforce what the Egyptian army had lost in the revolt. In $YEAR$, Druze militias rose up against their Egyptian rulers in Hauran and defeated a 400-man force led by Ali Agha al-Busayli, the governor of Hauran. A number of other small expeditions followed but were unable to achieve any decisive victory. Druze from Mount Lebanon flooded into the Druze force as skirmishes continued for the next few months. Months later, the Druze were decisively defeated in the Wadi Bakka by Egyptian forces. Following this, Druze forces in Palestine looted the Jewish quarter of Safed while the main force moved south where they were decisively crushed at Shebaa and soon laid down their arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA167000;Stop this revolt by any means necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC167010;Following years of servitude to Druze masters and heavy taxation, Maronite peasants revolted against their masters on Mount Lebanon. They were met by Druze irregulars who were supported by the nobility. Conflict has engulfed the region, with a number of massacres taking place throughout eastern Lebanon, and it seems like this is only just the beginning. Our officers are reluctant to get involved in Christian affairs, but are nonetheless moving their forces into the area. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME167010;Conflict on Mount Lebanon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB167010;We must stop this conflict before it is too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC167020;News that the Levant is engulfed in a civil war has reached the streets of Paris. Christians have been massacred and churches burned to the ground throughout Lebanon and Damascus. Ottoman forces have not done anything to quell the violence and only look on. In 1523, France swore that it would protect Christians living in the Near East from conflict and European powers have pressured us to stay true to our word. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC167030;Recent economic expansion has brought new business to the area around Jabal ad-Druze in Southern Syria. Such expansion has come at a cost as taxes need to be levied in order to pay for railroads and other infrastructure, which have angered the locals. A business dispute between a local Druze chief and $COUNTRY_ADJ$-supported business dealers. Our officers have mustered 35 battalions and have swiftly brought the revolt to an end, killing many of the region’s Druze inhabitants and disarming those who have surrendered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA167030;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168000;With special protection guaranteed to them by the French, the Maronite economy, driven by an increase in silk output, boomed. Pockets of Maronites were now filled with much-needed money and with it came a desire for better education and a population boom. For the first time, many women had an individual income and began to seek better conditions in both their work and in their general public life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168000;Mount Lebanon Silk Boom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168000;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168010;With the openings of the Suez Canal and an increase in silk exports from Asian lands, the price of Lebanese silk halved and never recovered. The population boom that Mount Lebanon once experienced resulted in an elevated population that could no longer support itself on Lebanese soil. Many men and women migrated westward to seek better employment opportunities. While some of them came back years later, many permanently settled down in their new countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA168010;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168020;While visiting the hills around the Lebanese city of Baalbeck, some of our countrymen noticed a large number of Roman ruins which had been preserved in the dry environment. When they returned with this news, a team of archaeologists was dispatched to the site. They were able to document and catalogue a large number of artefacts from the site. The most notable of these include Persian pottery shards which date from the 6th century BC. These shards are adorned with cuneiform lettering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168020;Ancient Ruins in Baalbeck;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168020;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168030;In the beginning of the 19th century, Lebanon had an increasing number of Western missionaries visit it. Many of these missionaries established school and printing presses in Beirut which catered to the city’s Christian population. Despite this recent surge, education was not a new concept for Lebanese Christians. A Syriac printing press was established in 1610 and Jesuits founded a school in 1624. American missionaries began their efforts in 1834 with another printing press and school. By the mid-1840s, it was noted by American missionaries that between a quarter and a third of men in Lebanon were literate and by the beginning of the 20th century nearly half of all Lebanese children could read, a feat which was hardly matched anywhere outside of the West at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168030;Missionaries in Beirut;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168030;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168050;A Kuwaiti general who is loyal to us brought the Sheikh of Qatar a number of Turkish flags. The Sheikh distributed them to his family members who flew them around the peninsula. The British, who believed that this was the direct doing of the Turks, felt that their Gulf holdings were at risk of Ottoman seizure and deployed a gunboat to the coast of Qatar. In response to this, the Sheikh of Qatar has sent a representative to request soldiers and equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168050;Qatar Requests Protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168050;Promise them protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB168050;We cannot guarantee protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168060;The burden of Ottoman bureaucracy and rule has sparked an uprising in our Qatari dominion by Qatari nobles. Our officials in the Baghdad Vilayet dispatched soldiers to quell this rebellion who laid siege to the fort at Al Wajbah. Our soldiers were unable to take the fort and retreated back to our fort in Shebaka where the Qataris laid siege to it. After their water supply was cut off by the rebels, our soldiers surrendered and were given an opportunity to leave the peninsula in exchange for freeing Qatari prisoners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC169001;During my few days of service in this government I’ve learned of a few secrets and have come across something interesting. The deportation order was issued through official channels by the minister of the interior and sent to the provinces. Following this order the Central Committee circulated its own ominous order to all parties to allow the gangs to carry out their wretched task. Thus the gangs were in the field, ready for their atrocious slaughter… The ‘mission’ in the circular was: to attack the convoys and massacre the population… I am ashamed as a $COUNTRY_ADJ$. What a stain on the reputation of $COUNTRY$, these criminal people…\n The first-hand report of a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ defector made the newspapers headlines of one of the Great Powers.

EVTDESC190300;A new heretical religious movement is forming in our lands, as a man proclaiming himself 'the Bab' is doing away with the old interpretations of the Quran. Instead he is offering his own interpretation of the text, looking for hidden meaning behind every individual letter. His radical new interpretation already sits poorly with the ulama -the religious authorities-, but his claim to authority to do so is what really infuriates them. He claims that the Qa'im [the redeemer] has arrived and that his is in contact with Him [he is the gate -Bab- to the Qa'im].\n\nNot satisfied with proclaiming himself just the Bab, in his rising popularity he is now proclaiming that he is indeed the Qa'im himself. And as Qa'im he has the authority to abrogate the Sharia. An act which was pushing it to far for the ulama: They have declared his movement heretical and are demanding that the Bab be put to death as an apostate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190301;One of the core teachings of the heretic the Bab is the imminent arrival of 'He whom God shall make manifest', or the messiah who shall establish God's kingdom on Earth. Long have the Babis been on the lookout for such a man, and now one by the name of Baha'u'llah claims to be him. While incarcerated in the Siyah-Chal prison, he claims to have had a a vision from the 'Maid of Heaven' proclaiming him the 'best beloved of the worlds' and having the 'power of the Sovereign within him.' In other words, he is the one prophesied.\n\nBaha'u'llah's claim is rapidly gaining acceptance among the Babis, and his presence in our realm is sure to reinvigorate the Babi cause and increase their militancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Amongst these people is a man named Baha'u'llah, who claims to the fulfilment of the Babi prophecy of there coming a man 'whom God shall make manifest' and restore the kingdom of God to Earth.

EVTDESC190304;Ever since tobacco was introduced into Persia last century, the Persians have taken a great liking to its use. It has become a staple of life for both men and women: many men spending their spare time in the great coffee houses smoking. It should come as no surprise then that tobacco cultivation has taken off massively in Persia, with over 200,000 people employed in the sector at this moment. Blessed with excellent soil and a good climate the Persian tobacco is of excellent quality. As a result some of the varieties of Persian tobacco are much prized in foreign markets. Yet until this moment in time there has been no foreign penetration of the tobacco trade in Persia: the entire market is still controlled by the Persians themselves.\n\nA group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ entrepeneurs have now taken it upon themselves to change this, and are looking to enter into a deal with the Shah to gain control over the tobacco trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Throughout his tenure he passed a wide variety of administrative, cultural, and economic reforms, most immediately a vaccination campaign against smallpox. While his reforms have proven to be valuable for the realm, it is not without its opposition.

This has greatly reduced expenses and strengthened the position of the central government, but it has also upset a large number of nobles who lost their patronage. Together with Tanzimat inspired breaking of the ulama, the reforms have given the central government undisputed authority. But not just of the central authority, but also of Amir Kabir.

Something which can only be considered a clear provocation by the Muslims populace, though some claim it was a veiled women who put it there. The next day a bazaari came forth and claimed his daughter was taken by Jews and killed for her blood. A claim enraging the crowd which made for the Jewish quarter the following day.

EVTDESC190347;'Most Persian would rather forego bread than tobacco, and the first thing they would do at the breaking of the fast during the month of Ramadan was to light their pipes.' -European observer\n\nWhen the religious authorities issued a fatwa banning smoking, many happily obliged in an effort to rid the country of the Tobacco Regie and the foreign domination coming with it. However, while most enthusiasticly joined in, as the ban dragged on many found that stopping smoking was more difficult than anticipated. Not only is smoking thoroughly ingrained in Persian culture, it is also terribly addictive. As time wore on slowly people started circumventing the ban and started smoking again. As the fatwa lost influence, so did the hold of the ulama on the people decline. By now few still participate in the protests and most have, begrudgingly, accepted the reality of the Tobacco Regie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, Herat has always been considered a principality under Persian suzerainty.

EVTDESC190359;According to Islamic law it is forbidden for a women to be in contact with a unrelated male, they are even barely allowed to show themselves to unrelated males. This has left women to spend most of their lives in the private world of the family. So engrained in our culture has this become that a common name for a wife is manzel: 'the home.' Rich or poor, women are confined to, and devote their entire lives to, the family. Unless girls are born into well-to-do families, their birth is less enthusiastically welcomed. In some families it has gotten to the point that it is a nang (social disgrace) to give birth to girls.\nYet women are not some mindless automaton, they have a will and mind of their own. Sensing the opportunities the Constitutional Movement -with its focus on modernising- offers, the women of Tehran have now taken to the streets demanding equal treatment.

Forbidden by Islamic law to interact with, or even being seen by, unrelated males, women live a hidden life behind closed doors. On the rare occasions that they do venture out, they do so 'wrapped in black bags from head to the toe without even an opening to breathe.' Yet, it would be a mistake to consider women to be powerless bystanders. From the tobacco protests to the Constitutional Revolution, they have been at the forefront of all public protests in recent history. Yet society does not recognise this.
