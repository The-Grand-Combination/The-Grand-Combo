EVTDESC90000;As everyone knows, $CB_TARGET_NAME$ is out to get us. It’s only a matter of time before they launch an unprovoked attack, so it is only reasonable that we take steps to pre-emptively defend ourselves. As luck would have it, a report detailing their nefarious schemes has recently been ‘leaked’ to the press, and the public have rallied to our cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90000;The $CB_TARGET_NAME_ADJ$ menace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90000;They’re coming right for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90001;In a rather embarrassing blunder, several of our soldiers in the uniform of $CB_TARGET_NAME$ have been caught while trying to sneak across the border. While the rumours that their task was to stage a border incident to justify our invasion are totally unfounded, it would be wise not to provide any fresh fuel for the fire right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90001;Mission to $CB_TARGET_NAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90001;What are you talking about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90002;For too long people have suffered under the malign influence of $CB_TARGET_NAME$. For the good of all involved we must reveal the evidence of $CB_TARGET_NAME$’s mismanagement to the world and bring their Sphere members under our wing for their own good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90002;The tyranny of $CB_TARGET_NAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90002;We will save them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90003;Despite having very much non-made-up proof that $CB_TARGET_NAME$ are up to no good there seems to be no public or international support for rescuing the poor lesser nations from their sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90003;The tyranny of $CB_TARGET_NAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90003;Fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90004;Without the protection of a Great Power such as ourselves anything could happen to $CB_TARGET_NAME$. In order to protect them they must be added to our Sphere of Influence, despite any short-term objections they might have. After all, if they any sense they would be Great powers too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90004;Protecting the $CB_TARGET_NAME_ADJ$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90004;We’re here to help you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90005;Although we only want to help $CB_TARGET_NAME$ by adding them to our sphere of influence they have gotten very worked up about it. While unseemly to all involved, their behaviour has rather turned international opinion against forcefully requesting they join us in our prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90005;The $CB_TARGET_NAME_ADJ$ Fiasco;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90005;Good call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90006;Why should $CB_TARGET_NAME$ get all the prime colonial land? It’s downright unfair, that’s what it is! They probably aren’t even properly exploit-educating the native population! Something must be done we deserve our place in the sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90006;An end to $CB_TARGET_NAME_ADJ$ Imperialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90006;Good call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90007;Despite the modest nature of our just demands, there seems to be no international support for re-adjusting the colonial balance between ourselves and $CB_TARGET_NAME$. While this is a setback, we have no doubt that one day we will possess and empire that the sun never sets on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90007;Colonial Setback;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90007;Good call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90008;$CB_TARGET_NAME$ is getting too big for their boots, as all can agree. For too long they have been strutting around the world stage, thinking they can do as they will. Thankfully, at last the rest of the world agrees, and our population is solidly behind us: $CB_TARGET_NAME$ must be taken down a peg or two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90008;It’s time to act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90008;Good call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90009;While the hubris of $CB_TARGET_NAME$ is evident to us, apparently others fail to see it. Their so-called ‘sovereignty’ apparently allows them to have their own army and to do as they will without deferring to us. It has even been implied that we are the arrogant ones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90050;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteiner desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII. The treatment of Danish people in Schleswig living under Holsteiner domination has led to a call for the duchy to be incorporated into $COUNTRY$ proper. This is unlikely to be looked on favourably by the conservative German aristocracy in Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90050;The Annexation of Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90050;Schleswig is a part of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90051;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ crown wishes to annex the Duchy of Schleswig, which has long been considered indivisible from the Duchy of Holstein. The German aristocracy is enraged by this move. They believe their future lies with the German Confederation to the south, but the Duke of Augustenberg has a stronger claim to Schleswig than the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ King. Schleswig-Holstein must forge its own path, even if it means war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90051;The Annexation of Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90051;Schleswig-Holstein is German.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90052;Now that order has been restored to Schleswig-Holstein, international pressure is mounting to uphold treaties regarding the region. Failure to restore nominal independence to the duchies and keep them united will result in tensions between $COUNTRY$ and other European powers and possibly war with the German Confederation to the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC90052;We will not bow to pressure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90053;King Frederick VII has died and left no heir. According to the recently-drafted constitution, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of Glücksburg. The crown of Holstein is more problematic, however. The House of Augustenburg claims the crowns of both Schleswig and Holstein and is calling on German support. If the new constitution is signed, Schleswig-Holstein will be officially divided. If it is not, the Danish people will almost certainly rise up against their new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB90053;Do not sign the constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME90054;The Schleswig-Holstein Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB90054;We can do nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90055;The question of Schleswig-Holstein’s place within the German Confederation has now finally been resolved-in our favour. This will have larger repercussions, as the free German states will see that $COUNTRY$ is the true leader of the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90055;Our mastery of Germany awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90056;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. This puts it in a unique position to assume leadership of the German Confederation as well as dominance over the North German states. We will need to take swift and decisive action if $COUNTRY$ is to maintain its position of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90056;How DARE they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90057;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. It’s possible that aligning ourselves with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is far more in our best interest, as well as more likely to create a united Germany under North German dominance. We should reconsider our current allegiances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90057;Look to $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90057;Maybe a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ future is better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB90057;We are better off as we are now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90059;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is attempting to fully integrate Schleswig-Holstein into its administration, in violation of its centuries-old treaty commitments to recognize the duchies’ autonomy. Furthermore, Holstein is a member of the German Confederation, and its duke now petitions us for support.

EVTDESC90060;The Ottoman Empire has been in slow decline for much of the last century, but never has this been more apparent than in recent years. The Empire’s hold on the Balkans is weakening, and this threatens to upset the entire balance of power in Eastern Europe as Russia and other countries will inevitably be drawn into the conflict. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government feel that it falls on us to call the powers of Europe together and negotiate a settlement that will restore some semblance of stability to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB90060;This is unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90061;Now that plans for the conference in $CAPITAL$ are underway, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ statesmen are busy trying to determine what our stance on the issue should be. Some feel we should favour keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East.

EVTOPTA90064;We will not risk our relationship with the Ottomans for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90065;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that the Ottoman Empire needed to be kept strong, and any demands placed on it should not weaken its interests unduly. Few of the attendees were pleased, the Russians in particular, and even though the Congress favoured the Ottomans it remains to be seen whether they will bow to European pressure and uphold the Congress’s edict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA90065;This is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90066;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans, with delegates from the Ottoman Empire also in attendance. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that creating stability in the region was best even if it came at the expense of the Empire’s power. The Russian delegates were pleased, but Ottoman delegates left in a rage. It remains to be seen whether they will bow before the Congress’s demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90066;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Stabilize the Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90067;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with mixed news: though the consensus reached was that $COUNTRY$ needed to be kept strong, they still placed numerous demands upon us that would see the political map of the Balkans rearranged.

EVTDESC90075;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now it has become all too apparent, and a threat to the vision of the Ottoman Empire as master of the Orient, something which has been little more than an illusion, but which the Ottomans must either address or have it shattered forever.

Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion. There are those who feel that a peaceful solution is possible, and that the Egyptians might better serve as powerful allies than as implacable enemies, but that would require us to surrender our claim to Egyptian lands as well as be an affront to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pride. \n \n Â§RNOTE: In case of war, you need to enforce the ‘Make Puppet’ CB on Egypt to inherit it.Â§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB90076;We are willing to negotiate a settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90077;While we expected immediate Ottoman reprisal, it seems our former overlords are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: split the Levant between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, allow Ottoman influence to remain and they will permit our independence. Of course, while this would retain an alliance with the Empire it seems like many to hardly be true independence at all. Still, it would avoid a great deal of bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90077;Negotiations with the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90077;We agree to the proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB90077;Never! We reject all Ottoman influence in Egypt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90078;Our negotiations have been successful: Egypt has agreed to partition the Levant, and we retain influence within their territory. While this spares us a great deal of bloodshed (and the possibility of an embarrassing defeat), it does mean we have lost control over the Christian Holy Land in Palestine-something that will not go over well with the powers of the world, and with Russia in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90078;Egypt Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90078;This is for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA90079;So it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90080;The Turks have proven unable to retake the Levant from us, despite all the assistance they have received from the rest of Europe. Even those great powers must now admit that the Levant rightfully belongs to us, and that the ‘Sick Man of Europe’ has no claim over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Racial tensions erupt through the deep south as other communities seek to join this state, but for the moment their control is only secure in the state of Mississippi.

EVTDESC95518;Matabele core territory was overrun by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers. King Mzilikazi gathered his followers and started marching north in search of territory to settle, eventually invading the Rozwi Empire and taking their lands. Many of the Kalanga people were incorporated and the rest were made satellite territories who paid tribute to the Matabele Kingdom. Mzilikazi called his new nation Mthwakazi, a Zulu word which means something which became big at conception, in Zulu ‘into ethe ithwasa yabankulu’ but the territory was called Matabeleland by Europeans.

EVTOPTA95518;At least we didn’t lose everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95519;Around 1821, the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan defied Zulu king Shaka, and set up his own kingdom. He quickly made many enemies, not only with the Zulu king, but also with the Boers, Griqua and Tswana. Defeats in several clashes convinced Mzilikazi to move north towards Swaziland. Going north and then inland westward along the watershed between the Vaal and the Limpopo rivers, Mzilikazi and his followers, the AmaNdebele, (called Matabele in English) established a Ndebele state. During this period, the Matabele left a trail of destruction in their wake. Roughly starting from 1826 to $YEAR$, widespread killings and devastation were ordered to remove all opposition. Mzilikazi reorganized the territory to establish the new Ndebele order. The death toll has never been satisfactorily determined, but the whole region became nearly depopulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After a long stay in Fouta-Toro, he moved to Dinguiraye. This became the staging ground for his $YEAR$ jihad. Umar Tall struck out against our weakened empire with great success-taking first Kaarta and then Segou. Umar Tall’s mujahideen readily defeated our forces, seizing Ségou itself and declaring an end to the Bambara Empire (which effectively became part of the Tukulor Empire).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC95610;Advisers to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the Russians will continue their southward expansion. If we do not press north from India, we will soon find the Russians on our doorstep... And, at that point, it will be a quick step for them to invade the British Raj directly. Steps must be taken to set up puppet governments between us and them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME95610;The Great Game;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC95611;Advisers to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the British will continue their northward expansion. If we do not press south, Russia will soon have its southern borders exposed to European invasion. It does us no good to allow the British complete hegemony over Central Asia. Something must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95612;The Great Game between the British Empire and Russia has one pushing ever northward and the other pushing ever southward, with $COUNTRY$ caught in-between. Recently, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers got into a skirmish with one of our neighbours... and the resulting incident has brought the infernal gaze of one of these powers upon us, perhaps meaning war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME95612;The Great Game Comes To $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95612;This is not good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95613;Thanks to the Great Game and its manoeuvring, tensions with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been rising. Recently, an incident occurred near their border where several $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers were attacked by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers. There were several deaths, and while the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is apologetic there are those within $COUNTRY$ who are calling for us to move in and assume control of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC95616;Unrest within $FROMCOUNTRY$ against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule has reached a boiling point, and it appears the only solution is to step in and rule them directly.

EVTDESC95639;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Recently, in the southern region of Cochin China, one of the local aristocrats took offense to the intrusion of several missionaries and executed them-without our leave. Word of the deed has reached the attention of the French government, meaning their eye will almost certainly turn to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95639;This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95640;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities.

EVTDESC95652;$FROMCOUNTRY$ diplomats have arrived in $CAPITAL$ with a set of demands: namely that we should surrender control of all eastern territories not ‘rightfully ours’.

EVTDESC95655;We are in a difficult situation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces cannot hold out against the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ onslaught, and they plague us at every opportunity.

EVTDESC95660;Our relations with Bangkok soared over disputes of control over Laos.

The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ returned fire and forced their way to Bangkok. With guns trained on the Grand Palace in Bangkok, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ delivered an ultimatum to the Siamese to hand over the territory, to withdraw their garrisons there, to pay an indemnity of two million in reparation for the fighting at Paknam, and to punish those responsible for the killings in the disputed territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC96004;The constant state of war $COUNTRY$ is under has taken its toll on our people.

EVTOPTA96014;We simply wish our lands back;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96015;The defeat of $FROMCOUNTRY$ in their war has forced them to the negotiating table, and one of the terms for the breakup of their empire is our release from their direct rule.

EVTDESC96025;Now that we are in a state of total war, the idea has arisen that $COUNTRY$ should approach $FROMCOUNTRY$’s enemies to see if there are those who would join our side against them.

EVTOPTB96025;We don’t need more allies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96030;A diplomat from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us with a proposal: an alliance with them, to fight in a war against their enemy... who is certainly no friend of ours. While the alliance does not necessarily obligate us, the question really remains whether or not $COUNTRY$ even wishes to go to war.

All these resulted in general dissatisfaction. A liberal movement began to grow in Lucca where in $YEAR$ there was a series of demonstrations, culminating in a full-scale riot. At first Charles Louis, the Duke, tried to assert his authority, but the continuous unrest forced him to take refuge in the Villa of San Martino in Vignale.

Three days later, under pressure from many citizens, he returned to Lucca, where he was welcomed triumphantly. However, he was unable to cope with the pressure and on he left for Modena.

EVTDESC96173;The seeds of the revolution of $YEAR$ were sown prior to the Congress of Vienna, in 1812. This was during the tumultuous Napoleonic period when the Bourbon court was forced to escape from Naples and set up its royal court in Palermo with the assistance of the English navy. The Sicilian nobles were able to take the opportunity to force on the Bourbons a new constitution for Sicily that was based on the Westminster system of parliamentary government, and was in fact quite a liberal constitution for the time. However, post Congress of Vienna, Ferdinand IV of Naples (and III of Sicily) immediately abolished the constitution upon returning the royal court to Naples. The 1848 revolution was substantially organized from, and centred in, Palermo. The popular nature of the revolt is evident in the fact that posters and notices were being handed out a full three days before the substantive acts of the revolution occurred. The rebels are storming key cities and caught up the forces of our country off guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The new confederation was thus composed of three states: North Peru, South Peru and Bolivia, and its capital was the city of Tacna, in southern Peru. The creation of this new nation was very well received in the south of Peru, since this area was able to benefit fully from the lifting of the previous commercial restrictions, but was bitterly resented by the elite of Lima and the north of Peru, which had traditionally benefited from a close commercial relationship with Venezuela.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Orbegoso then appealed for help with General Andrés de Santa Cruz of Bolivia, who demanded that in exchange for his help, Peru enter a confederation with Bolivia. Now that we have successfully retaken power, the Bolivians are demanding that we honor our part of the deal.

During the heyday of Chañarcillo it produced more than 332 tons of silver ore until the deposits begun to be exhausted in 1874. But by 1855, Copiapó was already in decline.

EVTDESC97092;Patagonia and Araucanía are wild lands and not yet tamed, and both Chilean and our settlers have gone south for their countries, but there is no clear boundary yet defined, only an informal agreement to continue land ownership based on the division from before the wars of independence. However, back then, the land was unknown, even more so than today, so the ownership of many areas would be open to interpretation.\nSome in our government claim that, since Argentina declared independence before Chile, Chile has lost any claims they might have inherited from the Spanish, and that no negotiation is necessary. Others argue to split the land down the Andean peaks in hopes of avoiding war. Some even claim that the borders should be entirely determined by the settlements founded, rather by treaties in distant capitals disconnected from the situation in those harsh lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97151;News has arrived in $CAPITAL$ regarding an incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. They have done so, but some advisors bring up a possibility: if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is this fearful of Spanish power, perhaps now is the time to reassert our authority over our lost Spanish colonies? Cutting $FROMCOUNTRY$ down to size may force them to submit to our rule as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97151;That time has passed. Accept the apology and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97152;News has arrived in $CAPITAL$ regarding an incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Predictably, they have refused. This is a direct challenge to Spanish authority from a former colony. If we do not react in kind, we will lose a great deal of credibility. Perhaps now is the time to reassert our authority over $FROMCOUNTRY$? Cutting them down to size may force them to submit to our rule as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97152;There is no point in pursuing the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA97155;Our time shall come again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97156;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has arrived with the expected news: they have agreed to submit themselves to Spanish rule once again, if we so choose. Some might wonder if it’s worthwhile for Spain to involve itself in South American affairs, particularly since they will ultimately try to rebel out from under us. Perhaps we have proven our point?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97160;Spanish imperialism has raised its head once again, with the Spanish throne having gone to war with a neighbour in an effort to restore their lost influence. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are rightfully worried at what this means, and there are calls for us to take a stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA97165;No. We will stand on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97166;The Monroe Doctrine dictates that the United States is responsible for protecting the western hemisphere from encroachment from imperialists in Europe-such as what Spain is doing right now in South America. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put the Monroe Doctrine to the test and appealed to us for aid, asking for an alliance in case Spain should decide to expand its influence even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97170;In the troubled atmosphere of Sudan’s modernization, Muhammad Ahmad ibn as Sayyid Abd Allah, a fakir and religious leader, has proclaimed himself the Mahdi (or ‘guided one’). The son of a Dongola boat-builder, Muhammad Ahmad had become the disciple of Muhammad ash Sharif, the head of the Sammaniyah order. Now, combining personal magnetism with religious zealotry, he begun a war to unify the tribes in western and central Sudan, determined to expel us and restore Islam to its primitive purity. While the local government in Khartoum initially dismissed this man, further reports indicate the Mahdi possesses a great deal of magnetism-and his rallying call of driving all foreign presence out of the Sudan has gained him a large following. These Mahdists may prove to be a serious threat-especially if they capture Khartoum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97170;The Mahdist Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97170;Khartoum may not fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97171;Followers of the Mahdi have struck again, this time in the province of $PROVINCENAME$. The religious leader’s jihad against foreigners has sparked a local rebellion, one that the authorities have had a difficult time putting down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97171;Mahdists in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97171;Put down the uprising at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation’s independence... and while that isn’t yet true, as $STATENAME$’s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it’s an embarrassment to $COUNTRY$ and, given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony’s independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97175;Chaos in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97175;This cannot be allowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighbouring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn’t we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97180;Return of Our Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97180;We will assume control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB97180;It is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97181;We have lost control of the situation in $STATENAME$. The rebels have gained sufficient control that they have ejected the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors and declared their independence... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA97185;About time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97500;The French ambassador has arrived with the following demand: they wish the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to recognize them as the sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine, turning control over all Christian sites to the French. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca signed with Russia in 1774 states that they are the sole protector of Eastern Christians, and should we agree to the French demands it will almost surely lead to conflict with the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97500;Sovereign Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97500;Russia protects the Holy Land, not France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB97500;We will agree to the French demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97501;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our demand, stating that the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca grants Russia authority over Eastern Christians and not France. More than likely they simply fear what the Russians will do. A show of force combined with the enticement of a protective alliance might compel them, though that will certainly cause friction with the Russians and there are some who say we should discontinue this venture now while we still have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97501;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Our Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97501;Pressure them into accepting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB97501;Abandon our claim before this goes further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97502;The French are not willing to abandon their claims to the Holy Land. There have been several demonstrations of naval force along our coast, and these have been combined with offers of protection against Russian retaliation. If we agree, we have a friend in France but almost certainly war with the Russians. If we refuse, very likely we will have a war with France on our hands. Which would we prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97502;French Escalation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97502;We must give in to the French.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB97502;Never! Let them come, if they dare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97503;The French have successfully pressured $FROMCOUNTRY$ into accepting their claim of authority over Christian holy sites in Palestine, authority which has traditionally belonged to us ever since the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This is a breach of the treaty and a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97503;We are the protectors of Eastern Christians, not the French.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed that the French and the Roman Catholic Church should be the supreme Christian authority in the Holy Land, and have turned over control of Christian holy places-including the keys to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. This is in contravention to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treaty with Russia, and will no doubt lead to conflict, but is at the same time a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97504;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97505;Through a combination of military and political pressure, we now have no choice but to accept French claims in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97505;French Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97505;This will surely lead to trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97506;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressured the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97506;We intend to stay out of the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB97506;We will protect our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97507;Russia has control over $CAPITAL$, and much of our nation is either overrun or in complete chaos. We cannot continue. Our only option may be to surrender to the Russians and negotiate a treaty, in which we will doubtless be forced to hand over many concessions. Failure to do so, or should the Russians refuse our offer, could mean the war continuing for a very long time yet-and $COUNTRY$’s utter ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97507;The War is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97507;A dark day for the Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB97507;Never! There is still a chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us, begging for terms of surrender. What forces the Ottomans mustered against us have been beaten, and we control much of their Empire. What armies their Western allies sent have all been destroyed, and not a sight of a Western soldier can be seen within Ottoman Empire. They seem to have run out of steam, and cannot challenge us anymore on this issue. No doubt the powers of Europe will be displeased, but they as well as the Ottomans seem ready to sit down and negotiate a peace settlement. Such a treaty will prevent this war from continuing on interminably, and our goals of domination within Ottoman Empire will be achieved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97508;We accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB97508;We refuse. The war continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97509;The Russians have agreed to lay down arms. Now comes the difficult part: discovering how they wish to punish us with the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97509;The Russians Have Accepted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97509;A great relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97510;The powers of Europe have met in Paris to settle the recent matter of the Crimean War. One of the provisions set out is that the newly-united Romanians would receive the Budjak in southern Bessarabia (also known as Izmail) and that we will renounce our claims in the area. Other demands are that we cede the territory of the Åland Islands to Finland as demilitarized zone. Refusing would put us at odds with the rest of Europe and perhaps lead to further war. Accepting might repair some of our relations with Romania, but would definitely be a blow to our prestige and our interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97510;The Treaty of Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97510;Give them Izmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB97510;Never! They will have to take it from us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97511;The Ottomans have surrendered to the Russians. There is no need for our war to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97511;Stand Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97511;It’s about time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97512;As we suspected, the terms of Russia’s treaty are punishing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97512;There shall be a reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97513;French Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97513;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressured the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, we are a nascent European Power trying to find our place among the Greats, and helping our French Allies would surely help us in our cause to Italian Unification. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97514;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressured the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, what goes on the Balkan peninsula certainly is. Our old alliance with Russia, based on the Holy League, as well as our honour, demands we help them. However, an unchecked Russia running amock in our backyard is not a good look. This can be a great opportunity to further our influence in the Balkans, especially in Danubian Principalities. What are we to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97515;To this day we remain a subject of the Turks. A growing movement has demanded our independence, and there are those who believe an offer of alliance with the Russians along with a guarantee of returning their lands in southern Bessarabia might entice them to support our efforts. Still others fear what a war of independence with the Turks will do to our nation. Is it worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97515;Romanian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97515;We shall declare our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB97515;No, it is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97516;The Romanians have approached us with a deal: in exchange for our assistance in their war of independence against the Turks, they will return our lands in southern Bessarabia. It is a way to regain our influence in the region, though it does come with a steep price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97516;We will assist the Romanians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB97516;We are not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97517;We have received word from the Russian government: they have agreed to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97620;Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun of Japan, has died childless. This has begun a struggle within the bakufu to select a replacement. The southern tozama daimyo wish to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu become shogun, while the fudai daimyo and shogunate officials are more in favour of Tokugawa Iemochi-even though he is still but a child. It seems certain that, no matter which candidate is victorious, the disaffected daimyo will see this as a loss of power and make trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97623;Pandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed shogun-instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama.

EVTDESC98649;For long, the seat of Metropolitan of Montenegro has been de facto a hereditary position. The Metropolitan would rule Montenegro, the small but de facto independent state surrounded by the Ottoman Empire. The last Metropolitan, Petar II Petrovic Njegos, before his death he named his nephew Danilo as his successor. When Njegos died, the Senate, under influence of Djordjije Petrovic, proclaimed Njegos’s elder brother Pero Tomov Petrovic as Prince and not Vladika. Nevertheless, in a brief struggle for power, Pero Tomov, who commanded the support of the Senate, lost to the much younger Danilo who had more support among the people. In $YEAR$ Danilo proclaimed the secular Principality of Montenegro with himself as Prince and formally abolished theocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99937;Georges Ernest Jean-Marie Boulanger, nicknamed General Revanche, was a French officer who was noted for his bravery and leadership during the Franco-Prussian War and was among the leaders of the Third Republic who crushed the short-lived Paris Commune. \n \n With backing from his direct superior, Henri d’Orleans, duc d’Aumale (incidentally, one of the sons of former king Louis-Philippe), Boulanger was made a brigadier-general and in $YEAR$ was appointed director of infantry at the war office. His base of support and popularity comes from the working districts of Paris and other cities, plus rural traditionalist Catholics and royalists, however he was initially seen as a Republican.

A dispute followed as to whether the arrest had taken place on French or on German territory, but regardless, under the circumstances Schnaebele is entitled to immunity even if on German territory, since he had been invited to a conference by German officials. \n \n The reason given for the arrest was that in a previous inquiry, evidence had been produced that Schnaebele was involved in transmitting information as to German fortresses, furnished by Alsatians in the pay of the French Government, in other words, the Germans believe Schnaebelé to be a spy. \n \n What should the response of the French Government be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A dispute followed as to whether the arrest had taken place on French or on German territory, but regardless, the French claim Schnaebele is entitled to immunity even if on German territory, since he had been invited to a conference by German officials. \n \n It is suspected by German officials that Schnaebelé had been spying on German border fortresses for the French Government, however the circumstances behind his arrest may put us in a negative light despite of the proofs of guilt. \n \n What should our response to the French be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Although the German Government considered, in view of the proofs of guilt, the arrest to be fully justified, it was deemed expedient to release Schnaebelé on the ground that business meetings between frontier officials ‘must always be regarded as protected by a mutually-assured safe conduct.’ \n \n Although many in France believe Bismarck backed down because he was afraid of Boulanger, the French Army is no better off than it was during the Franco-Prussian War. \n \n There is now question on what to do with Boulanger, with many within the government to have him sacked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Bonapartists had attached themselves to the general, and even the Comte de Paris encouraged his followers to support him. Once seen as a republican, Boulanger shows his true colours in the camp of the conservative monarchists.

According to Lady Randolph Churchill ‘all his thoughts were centred in and controlled by her who was the mainspring of his life. After the plebiscite...he rushed off to Madame Bonnemain’s house and could not be found’. \n \n Boulanger decided that it would be better to contest the general election and take power legally. This gave his enemies the time they needed to strike back, and activities of secret societies were soon forbidden and banned.\n \n Shortly afterward the government issued a warrant for Boulanger’s arrest for conspiracy and treasonable activity.

EVTDESC99976;Like vultures the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have descended upon us.

EVTDESC99978;The territories of the Left Bank of the Rhine, which French troops had conquered in 1795, had been returned to German (mostly Prussian) control after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, forming the Rhine Province. On $YEAR$, France shifted its focus to the Rhine, and the French government, led by Adolphe Thiers, restated its claim to the areas on the left bank, to re-establish the Rhine as a natural border. \n \n The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has called for German unity against a second French threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA99978;The Rhine is German! We will ally with Prussia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB99978;This does not concern us;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99979;During the Austro-Prussian War Brother’s War, Napoleon III promised the Prussian Prime Minister, Otto von Bismarck, of France’s neutrality, hoping that such an open statement of intent would strengthen France’s negotiating position regarding the western bank of the Rhine. Bismarck refused to offer any land from the Rhineland, which was Napoleon’s preferred region. However, he did make suggestions of French hegemony in Belgium and Luxembourg, although not committing anything to writing. \n \n Napoleon III has offered the Netherlands 50,000 guilders for Luxembourg. Being in deep financial trouble, the Netherlands accepted the offer. News of this purchase has caused nationalist fervour and public outcry across Germany we must decide what position $COUNTRY$ stands on the purchase.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME99981;The Luxembourg Crisis-$FROMCOUNTRY$ accepts the purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99982;With the German public angered and an impasse developing, Napoleon III sought to backtrack-he certainly did not want to appear to be unduly expansionist to the other Great Powers. Thus, he demanded only that Prussia withdraw its soldiers from Luxembourg City, threatening war in the event that Prussia did not comply. Tsar Alexander II of Russia called for an international conference, to be held in London. The United Kingdom was more than happy to host the talks as the British government feared that the absorption of Luxembourg by either power would weaken Belgium, a useful buffer between Germany and France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME99982;The Luxembourg Crisis-The Treaty of London;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA99982;Another Crisis has been avoided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99983;Despite our objections and attempts at meditation for a peaceful outcome, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has pushed through the sale and has annexed Luxembourg regardless of the will of the international community.

The boom of Chian shipping took place with the successful transition from sailing vessels to steam. \n \n To this end, Chian ship owners were supported by the strong diaspora presence of Chian merchants, the connections they had developed with the financing centres of the time (Istanbul, London), the establishment in London of shipping businessmen, the creation of shipping academies in Chios and the expertise of Chian personnel on board.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
