#  The AI wont build new buildings by itself. This event and the next one are meant
#  to give the AI access to those buildings at a resonable and realistic rate.
#  The conditions and modifiers are trying to replicate the decision making of building 
#  banks and universities. For instance, if the AI is investing lots of research points
#  into banking tech, it has higher chances of building banks, if it's spending very little
#  on education it has less chances of building universtities, so on and so forth.
#
#  It's by no means perfect, but if you let a game run for a while and tag to other countries
#  they will have a realistic distribution of Banks and Universities in their provinces.
#
#  Made by Wyrm.
#
# TO DO: Stop the AI from building where the terrain wont allow. Thankfully that's rare and has low impact.

## Event so the AI also builds universities
