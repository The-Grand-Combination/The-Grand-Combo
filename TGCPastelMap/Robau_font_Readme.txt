About:
======
This mod changes the map font in Victoria 2 to a solid color instead of the striped inner part. 

Installation:
=============
Extract this archive somewhere and then copy and paste the contents from the CaptRobau's Map Font Mini-Mod map to your V2 directory. Default this is: "C:\Program Files\Paradox Interactive\Victoria 2". Backup the original files before installing this mod. You can also use the Generic Mod Enabler (JSGME) which allows you to enable multiple mods at the same time while also keeping the original installation intact. You can find the latest version @ http://www.users.on.net/~jscones/software/products-jsgme.html
