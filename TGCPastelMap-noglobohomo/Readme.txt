################## INSTALLATION
Find your victoria 2 installation and put this folder and the .mod file in the mod folder,
then select /PastelThickBorders/ (slashes so it comes before all other mods) from the launcher on game start. 

###Just something I threw in together mashing couple of features various V2 map modders made for this game that still work for entirely reconfigured TGC mapmode
#Adds thicker borders from HFM and a more bright, less terrain-y looking political map for TGC from one of the MishMash mod variants
#Probably will work with any mod other than TGC
#Keep in mind that first time you run the mod (at least this is how it works with another mod/TGC), the borders will "double up" on the coastline, just alt tab your game, it will "crash"
#The next time you run the game, coastline borders will correct themselves and you will have no further issues going forward
#If you have any questions go to TGC's discord -- emprahtheodosius

#From the .fx creator:
################## CONTENTS
Contains a replacement terrain_2_0.fx file which modifies the pixel shader for the map when zoomed out.
I'm gonna guess based on context clues that the filename implies pixel shader 2.0 is necessary for the mod
to work, but maybe not? Your mileage may vary. -- u/rascalnag on reddit
