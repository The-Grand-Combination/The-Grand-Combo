## Tools and Utilities (Not Recommended) ##

## General Text Editing Best Practices ##
- *VERY IMPORTANT* Make sure all files are saved in Windows-1252 (or ANSI) character encoding. Many modern programs will save in UTF-8, which will result in odd characters. Reference for which characters can be displayed by Victoria II: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252
- Comment *every* item with at minimum the localisations of the item, so future modders know what is what.
- Write in British English
- Use Spell and Grammar Checks
- Decision, modifiers, goods, items, etc. code should be in all lower case.
- Organize the content txt files in alphabetical order, when it makes sense to do so.
- Exception: Organize decisions and event chains together when they are related.
- Events/Decisions deemed as ahistorical/fantasy add 'NOT = { has_global_flag = extra_flavour_disabled }' to trigger/potential
- Events/Decisions deemed as Colonial Railroading add 'NOT = { has_global_flag = colonial_railroading_disabled }' to trigger/potential
- Any microstate TAGs added should also be added to the option_disable_microstates decision in Setup.txt

## Templates ##
- Templates for /common/country, /history/country, and history/provinces are available in TGC - templates.zip, please use to build and update countries and provinces!

## Event Best Practices ##
- Use the most appropriate file in the mod/TGC/events/ folder
- When appropriate, use cultures / culture groups as limits rather than TAGs.
- Use localisation for event text rather than text in the code
- Use the following formats for localising your events:
	title = "EVTNAME#########"
	desc = "EVTDESC#########"
	option A = EVTOPTA##########"
	option B = EVTOPTB##########", etc.
- Keep events in each file either in numerical order or group order for event chains in each file
- Use Audax Validator after any edits
- Do not delete or rename any of the following event files:
	ACW.txt
	ANHFlavor.txt
	Arabia event.txt

## Files Best Practices ##
- Discuss with the lead developer(s) any additions or changes to common / inventions / poptypes / technologies / units files.

## How to set up Excel to Edit Localisation Files ##
# Mostly for Americans, Brits or those in other countries which use a period/full stop as a decimal separator #
- On Windows, open Excel. Go to File -> Options -> Advanced. Under Editing options, uncheck Use system separators. and change the Decimal separator to a comma and something else as the Thousands separator (Derek uses a period/dot/full stop). This will allow you to open the .csv files directly into Excel, with the contents nicely in cells.
- If you use a Mac, you can do this too, but you have to change the Decimal separator system-wide.
- This way you can also avoid breaking localisation files which have commas in their text and/or non-curly quotation marks.
- You can also hopefully avoid the stray cells which end up with a line in the files ending in x,,,,,, when viewed in a text editor, or something similar instead of just an x, which is how the lines should end. (Derek makes it a rule to delete all cells to the right of the x column when saving just in case).

## Map Best Practices ##
- Discuss with Hammonia (@Obstination#6820 on Discord) or lead developer(s) any province additions or changes. Ideally, we would like not to have to make any map boundary changes or additions after the next major update (0.2).
- Province localisation files for provinces should only have place names that existed in 1836. If this is not possible, try to keep names from 1840 or earlier.
- Use the current or 1936 names for provinces in the definition.csv. This is helpful for renaming decisions.
