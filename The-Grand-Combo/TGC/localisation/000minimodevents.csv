EVTDESC36898;On the 28th of June, 1838, princess Alexandrina Victoria of House Hanover ascended to the throne of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as 'Queen Victoria'. Her reign, which would last even a few years into the 20th century, would later be remembered as the absolute zenith of the British Empire, upon which the sun never set. The last British Monarch of the House of Hanover, her ascension also marked the end of the personal union between Britain and Hanover.

EVTNAME44360;Louis Riel Gains Public Notice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44360;The noted Louis Riel has become a figurehead amongst his people. He calls for increased rights for Metis people across Canada. Unique among his number, the young Riel has quickly risen to prominence due to his eloquent speech, his education, and his earnest beliefs. Leaving him alive would be a great example of Canada's freedom of speech, but the government can pull a few strings in order to effect a policy beneficial to the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME44361;William McDougall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44361;The Anglo-Canadian gentleman William McDougall has been proposed to be the Lieutenant Governor of the troubled Rupert's Land/North West Territories. His invaluable service and experience in the past puts him in a prime position to manage the territories, but some believe his anti-French and Anti-Metis policies to be too heavy-handed for the troubled territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA44361;He will do nicely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB44361;The climate calls for a lighter hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME44362;The Red River Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44362;The Red River Rebellion, later referred to as the First Riel Rebellion, was a rebellion that occurred soon after Canadian Confederation. The Canadian Government had installed an anti-French and anti-Metis liutenant governor, William McDougall, in the newly-bought North West Territory. When McDougall sent surveyors into what would eventually be the province of Manitoba, the restless Metis inhabitants sent their own delegation to intercept these surveyors and proclaimed the existence of the Metis Confederation. Historically, they established a provisional government in the new Confederation, which the Canadian Government tolerated while the situation developed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA44362;Let the situation develop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB44362;Acknowledge their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME44363;The Execution of Thomas Scott;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44363;Thomas Scott, an Orangeman of Irish descent, was executed by Louis Riel during the Red River Rebellion for conspiring against the self-proclaimed Metis provisional government. Historically, Riel wished to show the world that the Metis peoples were demanding to be taken seriously, but the Canadian Government viewed this action by Riel as a step too far and outfitted the Wolseley Expedition to quell the Rebellion. After conflicts with the Metis, Louis Riel was captured and exiled to the United States. With this, the Red River Rebellion was crushed, but the Metis and Native peoples would not soon forget this act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA44363;Our hands are tied. Outfit the expedition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME44364;The Return of Louis Riel and the Second Riel Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44364;After being elected to parliament three times in absentia after his exile, Louis Riel returned to Canada in 1884. Using increased Metis and Native cohesion, the ailing Riel managed to assemble a loose coalition to reattempt his rebellion for Metis independence in 1885. Historically, this rebellion was a failure due to internal strife amonst Rebellion leaders, an increasingly ill and megalomaniacal Riel, and increased Federal cohesion. Canada was no longer a fledgling nation just getting on its feet, and quickly moved to wipe out Riel and his rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA44364;We have no time for this. Let them be independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB44364;A United Canada is best for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC44364;The Metis have gone too far and must know their place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME44365;Louis Riel's Fate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44365;Historically, after surrendering to the Canadian forces after his failed rebellion, the Canadian Government held a quick trial in what can be best called a kangaroo court. Held in a hostile city before a jury of purely Anglo-Canadian Protestant jurors, the Catholic Metis Louis Riel was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death after a trial lasting only five days. Louis Riel refused to plea insanity, instead delivering two heartfelt speeches to the court, and later asserting to his lawyer that "Life, without the dignity of an intelligent being, is not worth having." Louis Riel was hanged on the 18th of September, 1885. His rebellions and the spirit of the Metis would largely die with him, but in due time he would be remembered as a folk hero amongst White, Metis, and Native people alike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME32530;General Volkhovski's Landing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32530;One of the first events of the restarted Caucasian War was General Volkhovski's landing in Circassia, near the modern town of Sochi. Originally plagued by setbacks due to Circassian resistance and poor organization, it was a good start and learning experience for the Russian armed forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32530;Let the landing commence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB32530;Let us bide our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32531;Conflict at Tepsue;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32531;The Russians made a large landing at Tepsue soon after the Caucasian War restarted, intending to crush opposition in western Circassia after their successful occupation of eastern Circassia a decade earlier. Historically, the occupation was a reasonable success, yet casualties were very high on both sides and neither belligerent forgot the lessons learned during this conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32531;We will crush the Circassians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB32531;We will do what is necessary and no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32532;Colonel Obshevski Gives A Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32532;Historically, soon after the conflict at Tepsue, Russian Colonel Obshevski gave a speech to the local Circassian population about the advantages of being under Russian control and the virtues of not rebelling against their Russian masters. The Circassians did not forget it, to the detriment of the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32532;Let the Circassians know who is boss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB32532;Is this really necessary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32533;Imam Shamil Gains Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32533;Imam Shamil has gained power and become the Imam of the Caucasian Imamate! His frequent attacks against Russian outposts throughout the region are worrisome, and a decision is needed as to what to do with his resistance movement. Historically, Imam Shamil became Imam of the Caucasian Imamate in 1834, becoming leader of the Circassian resistance against Russian occupation. He had a solid understanding of asymmetrical warfare and was honourable enough to gain the respect of the Russian Tsar and his generals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32533;Let us fight back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB32533;Attempt to pull out of our weaker outposts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32534;United Circassian Offensive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32534;The Circassian resistance has managed to take out our minor outposts through sneak attacks, seizing supply depots, and what can be termed guerilla warfare. Although we have suffered much, our ready state of alertness prevented an overly large massacre of our people and has prevented our major outposts and fortresses from being overrun by the Circassians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32534;They will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32535;United Circassian Offensive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32535;Although we attempted to pull out of our weaker outposts, the Circassians have ambushed our travelling forces and seized our supplies. Our larger outposts relied on these smaller reinforcements to properly defend, and we have suffered some losses in our major military and civilian centres. This perceived weakness has given the Circassians free reign to massacre our people, and has shamed us on a world scale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32535;An unfortunate event, to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32536;Imam Shamil offers a truce!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32536;Imam Shamil has stated his demands regarding the Caucasus: Independence, a return to the status quo of 1834, or death! Historically, the Imam and the Tsar agreed to a peace treaty, which was respected for almost a decade, as it worked out to both sides' advantage. The Russians had been humiliated at the Caucasus, but the Circassians could not hold out much longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32536;They will pay in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB32536;Let them go, we have failed in the Caucasus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32537;Unrest in the Caucasus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32537;There is increased unrest as of late, as Imam Shamil has begin a campaign of peaceful resistance and invective, wanting independence for his people and the Caucasus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32537;This has gone on too long. Send in the troops!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB32537;Organize our forces but do nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32538;Imam Shamil Stands Firm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32538;Imam Shamil has released an ultimatum: Caucasian independence or indefinite rebellion. His troops have already seized Russian supply depots and a few outposts, and as such he has dishonourably broken our treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32538;We will not stand this insolence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EBTOPTB32538;This is the last straw. Let them go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32539;Victories in the Caucasus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32539;A string of military and civil victories in the Caucasus has led to the breaking of most Circassian resistance! Imam Shamil is on the run and the back of the resistance is broken! It seems that the war that has raged for almost a hundred years is almost over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32539;A great day for Russians everywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB32539;Let the rebel scum suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32540;Ethnic Cleansing of the Caucasus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32540;Historically, soon after major victories in the Caucasus, the Russians purged the area of any undesireable elements. The ethnic cleansing continued until the 1870s, as many natives of the area were killed or deported to the Ottoman Empire. Indeed, the ethnic cleansing of the area has been considered by many historians to be the first ethnic cleansing on a modern scale and the harbinger of genocides as a concept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32540;We have fought for 100 years. Let them suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB32540;We need not descend into barbarism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32541;Imam Shamil Captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32541;Historically, Imam Shamil was captured in 1859. The Russians allowed him to live, albeit under surveillance in Kiev. The mutual respect that the Imam and the Tsar had for each other helped quite a bit in this aspect, and Imam Shamil saw the war as lost from this point. Although resistance continued in the Caucasus, the ideological centre of the movement was removed, and the ideological foundation of the resistance foundered. Imam Shamil himself received permission from the Tsar to go on the Hajj to Mecca in 1869. He briefly stopped at Istanbul where he was greeted warmly by the Ottoman Sultan, but continued on his way to Mecca. He died shortly after completing the pilgrimage in 1871, a truly remarkable figure in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32541;Let him live free, but keep an eye on him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB32541;Let him suffer the fate of all traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32542;The End of the Caucasian War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32542;The last pockets of resistance have foundered, the rebellion is leaderless, tens of thousands lie dead, and the Circassian/Caucasian War has finally ended after 100 years of bloodshed. The people of the Caucasus now know their place in the Russian Empire, but such wars are not that easy to forget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32542;Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32545;Taras Shevchenko rises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32545;Taras Shevchenko, a gifted Ukranian artist, has published his first major piece, a painting entitled "The Beggar Boy Giving Bread to a Dog". This piece is amazing, considering that it came from a man who until recently had been a serf. This painting seems to be stirring consciousness in Ukraine, but for now let us enjoy it for its excellence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32545;Good on him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32546;Taras Shevchenko Appears in the Spotlight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32546;Taras Shevchenko has been working for the past few years, but he recently made a defining piece named "Picturesque Ukraine". This has created a small awakening in the Ukraine, fueled by his unique paintings and stirring literature. Historically, Taras Shevchenko is even considered the father of the modern Ukrainian language and art styles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32546;Good to see that the underlings are prospering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32547;Taras Shevchenko Arrested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32547;Taras Shevchenko was found in the company of Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius, known dissidents against the Tsardom. During the raid of their headquarters, Shevchenko's new poem, "The Dream", was found. This poem personally attacked the Tsar Nicholas I and his wife. Although Tsar Nicholas personally read the poem, and was quite amused at the parts attacking him, he purportedly flew into a rage when the poem attacked his wife. Although a pardon for Shevchenko was likely, the attack against the Tsar's wife was the last straw, and Shevchenko was thrown into custody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32547;What has she done to deserve this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB32547;Literature is not as bad as violent opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32548;Taras Shevchenko Continues His Work in Exile;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32548;Although exiled from his native Ukraine and his residence in Saint Petersburg, Taras Shevchenko still had quite a bit of freedom. Even though the orders from the Tsar were to prevent him from working on painting and literature, the enforcement was very lax. The Tsar still had a soft spot for Shevchenko, and so the artist continued his work. Indeed, he was sometimes assigned to the military as a sketch painter, and his travels to Khazakstan and the Urals continued to shape his world-view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32548;He is of little harm to the integrity of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB32548;Enforce the conditions of his exile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32549;Taras Shevchenko Pardoned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32549;After ten years of imprisonment, the Tsar has felt pity for Taras Shevchenko and has pardoned him for his crimes. Although Shevchenko was ordered to the Nizhniy Novgorod area, his works are increasing in number and he has expressed a desire to go back to his native Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA32549;For better or for worse, he is a free man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME332550;Taras Shevchenko's Ukrainian Venture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC332550;Taras Shevchenko has finally returned to his native land after many years of toil in Russia. However, he was soon after charged with blasphemy and ordered to return to Saint Petersburg. His quick visit to the Ukraine raised consciousness about the Ukrainian people, and influenced his works in the days to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA332550;A pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME332551;Taras Shevchenko Dies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC332551;Taras Shevchenko has died due to his ill health. Although he barely spent any time in his native Ukraine, he will always be remembered as the father of the modern Ukrainian nation, language, and culture. His will requested that he be buried in his native Ukraine, and efforts are underway to give him a proper burial and wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC203800;A group of wealthy capitalists from your country has come to you after the recent attack on the Statue of Liberty.

EVTNAME203700;The Republican Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC203700;The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. To avert a republican backlash, the government adopted a series of credit and military policies and reforms to appease the land owners. The measures made by the government alarmed the civilian republicans and the Positivists in the military corps. They saw that it would undercut support for their own aims, and were emboldened to further action. For them, it had become a case of "now or never". Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring the Positivist officers to overthrow the monarchy. The Positivists launched a coup d'etat and tried to institute a republic on november 15, 1889. During the whole ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He only commented:;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME203701;The Golden Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC203701;The Lei Áurea (Golden Law) was sanctioned by Isabel, Imperial Princess of Brazil, who was regent at the time while her father, Emperor Dom Pedro II, was in Europe. It was signed on May 13, 1888 and was the law that abolished slavery in Brazil. It had only two articles. The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves – Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. The Brazilian government was also under pressure from Britain, who sought to end the slave trade in order to expand production in its own colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME203702;The Rise of Getulio Vargas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC203702;Vargas was born in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, into a family prominent in state politics. By 1922 he had risen rapidly in state politics and was elected to the National Congress, in which he served for four years. In 1926 Vargas became minister of finance in the Cabinet of President Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa, a post he retained until his election as governor of Rio Grande do Sul in 1928. From his position as state governor, Vargas campaigned unsuccessfully as reform candidate for the presidency of Brazil in 1930. While appearing to accept defeat, Vargas in October of that year led the revolution, organized by his friends, that overthrew the oligarchical republic. For the next 15 years Vargas assumed largely dictatorial powers, ruling most of that time without a congress. He held sole power as provisional president from Nov. 3, 1930, until July 17, 1934, when he was elected president by the constituent assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME203775;The Fascist Movement Arises;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC203775;A group of far-right extremists has begun to organize within the country, and their pamphlets have recently become a thorn in our regime's side. Their views are on the fringe, and their methods of spreading their views have been clandestine so far. They preach order, unity, strength, homogenous cultures, and national exceptionalism, and while this may please the common man, they are still a potential threat to our regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA203775;Keep an eye on them. Do you have the latest stock ticker?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME203776;The Fascists Go Openly Public;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC203776;Thanks to increased awareness of the fascist platform amongst our people, the fascist organizations within our nation have begun to go public in their demonstrations. They have begun to stalk the streets, intimidating others, and have attacked their communist ideological enemies. This roughhousing may or may not be good for the nation, but we can't explicitly support one side or the other without changing our regime or committing political suicide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA203776;Let the fascists play at politics a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB203776;We must keep order in the streets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME203777;Fascist Rallies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC203777;The local fascist organizations have largely united and created a series of awareness-raising and strength-flaunting rallies. These rallies have the amazing ability to inspire people and convert them to the fascist cause, and even have the potential to influence our very government. The communist and liberal groups within our nation have been pestering us to make a decision about these extremists, and this is surely a defining moment in our nation's politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA203777;I have to admit that their slogans are appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB203777;This has gone on for far too long. This must end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME203805;Greater Denmark rises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC203805;Given our glorious status in the world, nationalists within our country have taken it upon themselves to encourage a rebirth of our ancestral viking roots. While this has great traction amongst the already nationalistic, government intervention could give this movement the push needed to become a truly national movement. This will, of course, worry the rest of the world, but what are they compared to the glory and might of our nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA203805;FOR DENMARK!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB203805;What? No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME66689;Lucky Nations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC66689;Sometimes in this world, nations seem to be blessed by God in certain periods. Their leaders are brilliant, their people are hardy, they excel in warfare, produce amazing works of culture, and their economies boom. Do we live in such a world? If Lucky Nations are turned on, ten random civilized nations who are not Great Powers and five random uncivilized nations will be given special bonuses that will enable them to shake up the status quo of the world by giving them significant bonuses.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA66689;Turn Lucky Nations On.;;;;;;x

EVT180000DESC;Now that the war is over, the question arises whether or not we should allow the slaves we enlisted during the war to remain free, or send them back to work on the plantations. We made a promise to secure their freedom, but wars are a fickle thing, and some sacrifices have to be made for the betterment of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT181000DESC;With the dawn of the twentieth century, slavery in modern countries is fading away due to the prevalance of industry. A mere fifty years ago $COUNTRY_ADJ$ strength may have been founded on the backs of our slaves, but as tractors, automobiles, trains and other machines are making industry replace old mass labour, we have to make a distinct choice. Do we organize our slave economy, favouring it over industrial strength, or do we join the onward march of progress and free ourselves from the shackles that a slave society has forced us into? Just as fifty years ago a great house was divided, so now our $COUNTRY$ must become all one thing, or all the other: strong in the grip of slavery, or strong in the freedom of progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT183000DESC;The Confederate States of America are offering us our colony of Haiti, to be controlled by our government. This would allow us a stronger presence in the Caribbean and the New World a sa whole, so should we accept this offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT185000DESC;Without a leader, the Atlantic Slave Trade cannot continue. We have no choice but to end our trade, and focus on slavery within the bounds of our own country and neighbouring nations - or, should we have the power, we can lead the slave trade in place of the fools who dismantled it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT186000DESC;Once, we may have made slavery the centrepiece of our country, but those times have passed. The time of mass labour and the slave trade is over, and we now sever all our attachments to those detestable pieces of our history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME38510;Moving the Capital;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38510;In 1840 Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman moved his capital from the Omani city of Muscat to the economic heart of his empire, the African island of Zanzibar in a successful attempt to increase the amount of products he could export from the region.;;;;;;x
