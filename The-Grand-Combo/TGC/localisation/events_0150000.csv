EVTDESC160000;Each day tensions with the southern states are increasing, to the point some believe war is inevitable. While the government tries to ease tensions, the South seem to be preparing for war and there are some talks of outright disobeying the government of the United States in the South, with a parallel army and administration being built. While these rumours remain just that, a fragile peace remains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160000;Threat From The South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160000;Let’s see where this is going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160001;We are receiving disturbing reports of anarchy in southern China. A peasant army led by the rebels Feng Yunshan and Wei Changhui has declared the ascendancy of the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’ and driven out local governors. All within the Qing government agree that we cannot recognize these rebels as having credence-if we do, it raises the question of whether the Mandate of Heaven is still held by the Imperial throne. That cannot be allowed, and thus the governors must be given the opportunity to crush the rebels and restore order in the Emperor’s name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160001;Anarchy in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160001;Crush them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB160001;Out with the Manchu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160002;We have crushed the ‘Heavenly Kingdom’, and proven to all of China that the Qing Dynasty yet maintains the Mandate of Heaven. We will abide no more insurrections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160002;Taiping Rebellion Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160002;Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160003;Even though we are not yet done with the ‘Heavenly Kingdom’, the fact the rebels have forced us to a ceasefire and have not been crushed is being taken by our Chinese subjects as a sign of weakness. Officials are predicting rebellions in many other places in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160003;Truce With the Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160003;Unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160004;Though we are not yet done battling the hated Manchu, for the moment the Heavenly Kingdom claims victory. We have forced a truce, and now the Manchu will need to deal with rebellions across their land as the people realize their mandate to rule no longer exists. All the world watches us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160004;Truce With the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160004;Hooray!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160006;The continued existence of the Taiping rebels is an embarrassment to the Qing government and our Emperor. Calls have been made for the war to resume, and this time for a national effort be started to draft men into the Qing army. There will be considerable resistance, but the Emperor has decreed that the Heavenly Kingdom must be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160006;The War Against Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160006;The war must continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB160006;We cannot afford the repercussions of a draft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160007;The truce with the Qing Emperor has come to an end, and already the calls have begun for the Taiping Revolution to continue. The Manchu must be thrown down! All of China must be freed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160007;The War Against the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB160007;We are not ready to wage such a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160008;We have overthrown the hated Manchu and taken control of all China. Now, as the world watches, the true test comes: transforming the nation into the true Heavenly Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160008;The Taiping Are Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160009;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160009;The Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160011;Due to the low value assigned to the birth of daughters, female infanticide has become wide-spread across much of China. The practice has become so common, in fact, it has led to a shortage of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160011;The Female Shortage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160012;We have received reports of Christian missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’. Their actions would not be so objectionable if they were not also preaching sedition against the Manchu-and, far worse, though provincial governors have attempted to halt the missionaries this has only seemed to stir up support for them even further. There are sightings of their pamphlets all over $STATENAME$ now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160012;Taiping Missionaries in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160012;Collect the pamphlets and silence these missionaries-now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB160012;We shall tolerate this, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160013;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south. This is especially true in $STATENAME$, where there are reports of rioting after a recent confrontation between locals and Manchu officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160013;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160013;This cannot be tolerated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160015;He is of no consequence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160016;Reports have arrived at the palace that a firewood seller by the name of Yang Xiuqing has taken to walking the South lands, claiming to speak with the voice of God. Regardless of his seeming madness, the man has proven very effective at spreading the word of the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160016;Yang Xiuqing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160017;Followers of the ‘Heavenly Kingdom’ are causing further problems in the south. They are already heavily fortified within $PROVINCENAME$, and many Qing advisors consider it completely beyond our control. Anarchy seems rampant, and all throughout $STATENAME$ these rebels are shouting treason. Can nobody do something about this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160017;Pro-Christian Riots in $STATENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160017;This is starting to be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160020;The followers of the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’ have spread their influence even further. According to officials in $STATENAME$, the Christian rebels have been spotted in $PROVINCENAME$ and sentiment against the Qing Dynasty is on the rise throughout the entire state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160020;The Taiping Sect Spreads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160020;Hmm, that’s worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160025;Our beloved leader, the glorious and most holy Hong Xiuquan, has passed away-ascended into Heaven to receive his just rewards from God. Those of us who remain must now look to what will become of the Heavenly Kingdom without his guidance. There are some who say that his son, Hong Tianguifu, should be given the reins of power. Others say that Hong Tianguifu is a buffoon and that a republic is the way forward. Finally, a proper theocracy, without a hereditary rule, is another option that is considered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160025;The Death of Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160025;Establish a new dynasty under Hong Tianguifu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB160025;The Qing Dynasty must rule once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC160025;Let the army rule Taiping.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD160025;Keep the Theocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160026;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Formosa. The suggestion among what little remains of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taibei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160026;Retreat to Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160026;It seems we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160027;We no longer believe in the superiority of religion over state and must therefore rid ourselves of the moralist laws of our predecessors. China will no longer be dictated by the restrictive and oppressive laws that were proclaimed by the, so called, ‘brother of Jesus’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160027;End of the Christian Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160028;After, the now Christian nation that is China, requested help in converting the population, several of our clergymen have moved to help the Chinese cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160028;Missionaries move to China;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160501;Christian missionaries are stirring up trouble in southern China, handing out pamphlets in an effort to gain converts. This would not be so objectionable were the pamphlet not also preaching sedition against the Qing Dynasty. The fact that so many in $PROVINCENAME$ are willing to listen to these fools is worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME164503;The Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164504;The man behind the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’ has been given a name: Hong Xiuquan. A former farmer who attempted the civil service examinations in Guangzhou and failed, he has now become a charismatic visionary taking advantage of anti-Manchu sentiment in the south. Some say he is crazed and mad, but regardless he is a danger to the Qing Dynasty and his words are finding eager ears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC164506;Water might float a boat, but it can also make it sink.’\n Chinese proverb\n \n The Huang He [Yellow River] is the great river on which our empire-or indeed our civilisation-has been build, sustaining the fields of the millions living within its course and China as a whole. Yet, like the god Hebo, the river is unpredictable and greedy, taking from those whom it uplifts and nourishes. A mighty system of dykes has been built along the river to channel and tame it, and protect those living along it-and China as a whole-from its greed. Sometimes though, it still lashes out and inflicts ruin on all those along its path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME164506;The Huang He Floods of $YEAR$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164507;Despite all it brings to China, the Huang He river has also been called the Scourge of the Sons of Han, and with good reason: Throughout history it has flooded numerous times and inflicted unimaginable suffering on our people. Only a few years ago the river lashed out and killed hundreds of thousands, an event we are still recovering from. Few could have predicted the river to be so vicious and return so soon, yet it has. The Huang He has burst its dykes again, flooding the country side and shifting the river hundreds of kilometres to the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME164507;China’s Sorrow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA164507;But we haven’t cleared up after last time yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164508;And once more the Huang He taketh, and more viciously than any time before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME164508;The Great Flood of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA164508;Not again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164550;An earthquake has devastated the Ferghana valley, and a Turkestani Muslim leader by the name of Jahangir Khoja has taken advantage of the chaos to raise a rebellion against Manchu rule. The Uighur peoples of the northwest are rallying behind him, and the imperial garrisons in the region’s cities have been massacred. Qing cannot tolerate this sort of rabble rousing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME164550;Khoja Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164599;The forces of revolution have turned against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Emperor. With dissent threatening to spread into chaos, leaders of the Beiyang army have demanded the Emperor abdicate his throne. Cheering crowds in $CAPITAL$ greeted the news, but few are aware of the forces now lining up to take control of the government. Kuomintang revolutionaries have demanded a transformation of $COUNTRY$ into a republic with free elections. Army leaders, however, have threatened to oppose the Kuomintang and demanded the republic be under strict Beiyang control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME164599;The Xinhai Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA164599;The Beiyang Army will keep order in China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB164599;The Kuomintang will lead the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164600;Revolutionary societies are springing up all over China, and recently we have received word that several of these societies have banded together as the Tongmenghui or ‘Chinese United League’. Their stated goal is the revival of Zhonghua, or the concept that China should be a nation ruled by a republic that represents all of its various peoples. These revolutionaries wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed of foreigner influence, and do not seem satisfied to wait and see what reforms the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy will provide. What’s more worrying is that some of the regional warlords appear to be assisting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME164600;The Tongmenghui;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA164600;Try to work with these societies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB164600;Crush them. This will not be tolerated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164601;Revolutionaries seeking to bring down the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy have been stirring up a revolt in $STATENAME$. The incident appears to have begun in $PROVINCENAME$, after a demonstration by local workers turned violent. Though authorities have already moved in, the damage is done. What remains is to determine how we react to this outrageous provocation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME164602;Boxers in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC167000;Beginning with the Peasant’s Revolt of 1834 in Palestine, Druze nobles resented oversight. Their overlords considered them heretics and treated them as such. In the years following the Peasant’s Revolt, conscription was required in order to reinforce what the Egyptian army had lost in the revolt. In $YEAR$, Druze militias rose up against their Egyptian rulers in Hauran and defeated a 400-man force led by Ali Agha al-Busayli, the governor of Hauran. A number of other small expeditions followed but were unable to achieve any decisive victory. Druze from Mount Lebanon flooded into the Druze force as skirmishes continued for the next few months. Months later, the Druze were decisively defeated in the Wadi Bakka by Egyptian forces. Following this, Druze forces in Palestine looted the Jewish quarter of Safed while the main force moved south where they were decisively crushed at Shebaa and soon laid down their arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME167000;Druze Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA167000;Stop this revolt by any means necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC167010;Following years of servitude to Druze masters and heavy taxation, Maronite peasants revolted against their masters on Mount Lebanon. They were met by Druze irregulars who were supported by the nobility. Conflict has engulfed the region, with a number of massacres taking place throughout eastern Lebanon, and it seems like this is only just the beginning. Our officers are reluctant to get involved in Christian affairs, but are nonetheless moving their forces into the area. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME167010;Conflict on Mount Lebanon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA167010;This petty conflict does not concern us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB167010;We must stop this conflict before it is too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC167020;News that the Levant is engulfed in a civil war has reached the streets of Paris. Christians have been massacred and churches burned to the ground throughout Lebanon and Damascus. Ottoman forces have not done anything to quell the violence and only look on. In 1523, France swore that it would protect Christians living in the Near East from conflict and European powers have pressured us to stay true to our word. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME167020;$YEAR$ Mount Lebanon Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB167020;Unfortunately, we are unable to intervene at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC167030;Recent economic expansion has brought new business to the area around Jabal ad-Druze in Southern Syria. Such expansion has come at a cost as taxes need to be levied in order to pay for railroads and other infrastructure, which have angered the locals. A business dispute between a local Druze chief and $COUNTRY_ADJ$-supported business dealers. Our officers have mustered 35 battalions and have swiftly brought the revolt to an end, killing many of the region’s Druze inhabitants and disarming those who have surrendered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA167030;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168000;With special protection guaranteed to them by the French, the Maronite economy, driven by an increase in silk output, boomed. Pockets of Maronites were now filled with much-needed money and with it came a desire for better education and a population boom. For the first time, many women had an individual income and began to seek better conditions in both their work and in their general public life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168000;Mount Lebanon Silk Boom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168000;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168010;With the openings of the Suez Canal and an increase in silk exports from Asian lands, the price of Lebanese silk halved and never recovered. The population boom that Mount Lebanon once experienced resulted in an elevated population that could no longer support itself on Lebanese soil. Many men and women migrated westward to seek better employment opportunities. While some of them came back years later, many permanently settled down in their new countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168010;Mount Lebanon Silk Bust;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168010;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168020;While visiting the hills around the Lebanese city of Baalbeck, some of our countrymen noticed a large number of Roman ruins which had been preserved in the dry environment. When they returned with this news, a team of archaeologists was dispatched to the site. They were able to document and catalogue a large number of artefacts from the site. The most notable of these include Persian pottery shards which date from the 6th century BC. These shards are adorned with cuneiform lettering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168020;Ancient Ruins in Baalbeck;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168020;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168030;In the beginning of the 19th century, Lebanon had an increasing number of Western missionaries visit it. Many of these missionaries established school and printing presses in Beirut which catered to the city’s Christian population. Despite this recent surge, education was not a new concept for Lebanese Christians. A Syriac printing press was established in 1610 and Jesuits founded a school in 1624. American missionaries began their efforts in 1834 with another printing press and school. By the mid-1840s, it was noted by American missionaries that between a quarter and a third of men in Lebanon were literate and by the beginning of the 20th century nearly half of all Lebanese children could read, a feat which was hardly matched anywhere outside of the West at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168030;Missionaries in Beirut;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168030;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168050;A Kuwaiti general who is loyal to us brought the Sheikh of Qatar a number of Turkish flags. The Sheikh distributed them to his family members who flew them around the peninsula. The British, who believed that this was the direct doing of the Turks, felt that their Gulf holdings were at risk of Ottoman seizure and deployed a gunboat to the coast of Qatar. In response to this, the Sheikh of Qatar has sent a representative to request soldiers and equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168050;Qatar Requests Protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168050;Promise them protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB168050;We cannot guarantee protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168060;The burden of Ottoman bureaucracy and rule has sparked an uprising in our Qatari dominion by Qatari nobles. Our officials in the Baghdad Vilayet dispatched soldiers to quell this rebellion who laid siege to the fort at Al Wajbah. Our soldiers were unable to take the fort and retreated back to our fort in Shebaka where the Qataris laid siege to it. After their water supply was cut off by the rebels, our soldiers surrendered and were given an opportunity to leave the peninsula in exchange for freeing Qatari prisoners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC169000;Mass graves where found in $PROVINCENAME$, the bloody result of a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ purge against its perceived enemies. Throughout the whole of $STATENAME$, the situation is the same. In $CAPITAL$, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities are denying any knowledge of this while they try to suppress this information leaking outside of $COUNTRY$. They say it would damage the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ reputation and is best to deal with these matters internally. An ongoing government investigation has failed to find any culprits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME169001;Hundreds of Thousands Killed in $COUNTRY_ADJ$-led Massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC169001;During my few days of service in this government I’ve learned of a few secrets and have come across something interesting. The deportation order was issued through official channels by the minister of the interior and sent to the provinces. Following this order the Central Committee circulated its own ominous order to all parties to allow the gangs to carry out their wretched task. Thus the gangs were in the field, ready for their atrocious slaughter… The ‘mission’ in the circular was: to attack the convoys and massacre the population… I am ashamed as a $COUNTRY_ADJ$. What a stain on the reputation of $COUNTRY$, these criminal people…\n The first-hand report of a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ defector made the newspapers headlines of one of the Great Powers. Soon, more evidence started to appear: in $CAPITAL$, senior government officials scramble to contain the damage of the damning report.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC180000;Now that the war is over, the question arises whether or not we should allow the slaves we enlisted during the war to remain free, or send them back to work on the plantations. We made a promise to secure their freedom, but wars are a fickle thing, and some sacrifices have to be made for the betterment of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC181000;With the dawn of the twentieth century, slavery in modern countries is fading away due to the prevalence of industry. A mere fifty years ago $COUNTRY_ADJ$ strength may have been founded on the backs of our slaves, but as tractors, automobiles, trains and other machines are making industry replace old mass labour, we have to make a distinct choice. Do we organize our slave economy, favouring it over industrial strength, or do we join the onward march of progress and free ourselves from the shackles that a slave society has forced us into? Just as fifty years ago a great house was divided, so now our $COUNTRY$ must become all one thing, or all the other: strong in the grip of slavery, or strong in the freedom of progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC185100;In the eyes of our soldiers as they parade through the streets, nothing can be seen but utmost devotion to $COUNTRYNAME$ and the ideals for which our nation stands.

EVTDESC190130;For years Borneo has been a common destination for Chinese workers and settlers, many of whom are enticed to work for the rich sultans of the island in precious metal mining communities-kongsi, as they are called by the Chinese. In 1777, a Hakka Chinese named Luo Fangbo established one kongsi in Pontianak as a full-fledged independent republic, co-existing peacefully the with neighbouring sultans. It has helped protect Chinese settlers in Borneo for decades now, and as the first republic in the history of Asia, is a remarkably modern state for its time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190131;The Lanfang Republic is, although independent, a tributary state of the Qing Empire, and must pay occasional sums of money to the Emperor. In exchange, they ensure that new Chinese settlers from the mainland arrive safely in our capital, providing for a larger workforce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190132;An envoy from the Lanfang Republic in the south has come to our court with their tribute, just as expected of them. In return, we should send Hakka settlers to Borneo, to ensure their future growth and strength, so that they may remain an independent Chinese presence in the southern islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190133;These last years have been tumultuous for Lanfang, but in the face of adversity, we have managed to become a modern, Westernized country. There are still those in our midst who think that we have strayed too far from tradition, but most will agree that this is for the best. In order to hold Western imperialism back from our sacred borders, we must embrace what makes those same Westerners strong, and use it against them. Only in this way can we survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190300;A new heretical religious movement is forming in our lands, as a man proclaiming himself ‘the Bab’ is doing away with the old interpretations of the Quran. Instead he is offering his own interpretation of the text, looking for hidden meaning behind every individual letter. His radical new interpretation already sits poorly with the ulama—the religious authorities, but his claim to authority to do so is what really infuriates them. He claims that the Qa’im [the redeemer] has arrived and that his is in contact with Him [he is the gate-Bab-to the Qa’im].\n \n Not satisfied with proclaiming himself just the Bab, in his rising popularity he is now proclaiming that he is indeed the Qa’im himself.

While incarcerated in the Siyah-Chal prison, he claims to have had a vision from the ‘Maid of Heaven’ proclaiming him the ‘best beloved of the worlds’ and having the ‘power of the Sovereign within him.’ In other words, he is the one prophesied.\n \n Baha’u’llah’s claim is rapidly gaining acceptance among the Babis, and his presence in our realm is sure to reinvigorate the Babi cause and increase their militancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This has greatly reduced expenses and strengthened the position of the central government, but it has also upset a large number of nobles who lost their patronage. Together with Tanzimat inspired breaking of the ulama, the reforms have given the central government undisputed authority. But not just of the central authority, but also of Amir Kabir.

As harvests fail a major famine is developing. Bread is getting scarcer resulting in the price of bread doubling in Tehran, tripling in Isfahan and increasing more than 20-fold in some rural areas. As a result of these high prices those still holding grain have started hoarding their supply in the hopes of fetching a premium.

EVTDESC190345;As Jews are considered najis—ritually unclean—they have never been well liked, not just in $PROVINCENAME$, but throughout the realm. Incidents of bullying and violence against Jews are thus not uncommon. Last night, however, the Jews of $PROVINCENAME$ were subject to an egregious example of communal violence.\n \n An incident involving dog’s blood set in motion a massacre\n -though nobody is quite sure what happened exactly-\n A mob formed which, while the synagogue burned, looted the homes of Jews, with some even taking young girls to marry them. Before the Jewish patriarchs managed to restore order, and they only managed that by promising the wholesale conversion of Jews from $PROVINCENAME$ to Islam, 37 Jews were killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Recent events in Shiraz exceed the normal level animosity by a fair margin though.\n Trouble started when a copy of the Holy Quran was found in cesspool of a Jewish home. Something which can only be considered a clear provocation by the Muslims populace, though some claim it was a veiled women who put it there. The next day a bazaari came forth and claimed his daughter was taken by Jews and killed for her blood. A claim enraging the crowd which made for the Jewish quarter the following day. Yet it were the soldiers who were sent to protect the Jews who were the first to loot.\n Looting lasting for 7 hours, leaving 12 Jews killed, 50 injured and 6000 bereft of property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190347;Most Persian would rather forego bread than tobacco, and the first thing they would do at the breaking of the fast during the month of Ramadan was to light their pipes.’-European observer\n \n When the religious authorities issued a fatwa banning smoking, many happily obliged in an effort to rid the country of the Tobacco Regie and the foreign domination coming with it. However, while most enthusiastically joined in, as the ban dragged on many found that stopping smoking was more difficult than anticipated. Not only is smoking thoroughly ingrained in Persian culture, it is also terribly addictive. As time wore on slowly people started circumventing the ban and started smoking again. As the fatwa lost influence, so did the hold of the ulama on the people decline. By now few still participate in the protests and most have, begrudgingly, accepted the reality of the Tobacco Regie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Instead of quelling the riots, though, they turned their attention towards the citadel held by the loyal governor. While the citadel held for some time, it was not supplied to sustain a siege.

What is worse, however, is that Nayeb Isa has, without consulting us, executed Said-Mohammed Khan and appropriated his, and all his family’s, property.

Heavily influenced by the European enlightenment and constitutionalist thought, they have started a journal to push their agenda.

EVTDESC190359;According to Islamic law it is forbidden for a women to be in contact with an unrelated male, they are even barely allowed to show themselves to unrelated males. This has left women to spend most of their lives in the private world of the family. This has become so engrained in our culture that a common name for a wife is manzel: ‘the home.’ Rich or poor, women are confined to, and devote their entire lives to, the family. Unless girls are born into well-to-do families, their birth is less enthusiastically welcomed. In some families it has gotten to the point that it is a nang (social disgrace) to give birth to girls.\n Yet women are not some mindless automaton, they have a will and mind of their own. Sensing the opportunities, the Constitutional Movement-with its focus on modernising-offers, the women of Tehran have now taken to the streets demanding equal treatment.

Forbidden by Islamic law to interact with, or even being seen by, unrelated males, women live a hidden life behind closed doors. On the rare occasions that they do venture out, they do so ‘wrapped in black bags from head to the toe without even an opening to breathe.’ Yet, it would be a mistake to consider women to be powerless bystanders. From the tobacco protests to the Constitutional Revolution, they have been at the forefront of all public protests in recent history. Yet society does not recognise this.

The journal, however, is more than just a collection of amusing tales and anecdotes. It is a poignant satire of the clergy and the establishment and is more than happy to expose its corruption. But more than that, the paper is a call to modernise and accept more advanced Western social norms and practises. It viciously attacks what it perceives to be the backward lifestyles and values of the Islamic clergy and religious fanatics.\n Being richly illustrated it is not only accessible to the literate elite, but has also become a hit among the lower-illiterate-classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190365;With the growth in foreign trade slowly the tojjar—the prominent merchants—have become the dominant economic players, and not the patrimonial government agents. However, power by far and large still resides with the old elites who are thoroughly uninterested in economic reform, and would rather enrich themselves at the expense of the tojjar. We’ve been approached by a small group of tojjar who are demanding the removal of the ineffective and corrupt government officials and replace them with religious, unbiased and not avaricious men. Furthermore, they are demanding we install merchants’ assemblies in prominent cities and ports to represent the merchants interests and settle matters of commercial disputes, while promoting commerce and protecting merchants from foreign competition.\n The old elites, however, feeling threatened in their position, have allied with the ulama in opposition to the formation of these merchant councils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

One of the greatest opponents of the ulama is prime-minister Amir Kabir. Who, while working for the border committee instituted by the Second Treaty of Erzurum, closely followed the Tanzimat reforms of the Ottoman Empire and came to the conclusion that the only way to modernise and strengthen the empire is by limiting the power and influence of the ulama.\n He has now proposed measures to this effect.

But where the anjoman find fertile ground for growth among the more reform minded classes-and are slowly readying the minds of the general populace for change-the ulama is less than enthusiastic of their ideas. In their eyes many of the anjoman serve to spread corrupt ideas, shelter infidels, promote harmony between Muslims and non-Muslims, and, above all, constitute religious innovation contrary to Islamic precepts. As a result, the ulama is demanding we shut down the anjoman wherever we find them, the Faramus-kana foremost among them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
