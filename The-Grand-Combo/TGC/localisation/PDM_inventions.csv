adam_smith_desc;Adam Smith was a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher of political economy. He was author of The Theory of Moral Sentiments and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Smith promoted the central tenement of Capitalism as the individual pursuing his own self-interest, and in so doing, promoting the greater good. He talked about the 'invisible hand' that would guide the actions of individuals and argued against government interference in all but a aspects of the economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

jean_baptiste_say_desc;Jean-Baptiste Say was a French scholar active in the field of political economy. A contemporary of Adam Smith, he also advocated economic competition and freedom of trade. He wrote the Traité d'économie politique ou simple exposition de la manière dont se forment, se distribuent et se composent les richesses, originally published in 1803. Say's Law of Markets was derived thus from his treatise, 'Inherent in supply is the wherewithal for its own consumption.';;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

alexander_bain;Alexander Bain;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alexander_bain_desc;An associate of J.S. Mill, Alexander Bain added connections from physiology to associationist psychology, adding the laws of compound and constructive association to those of contiguity, similarity, and frequency. He was known for writing two of the earliest textbooks in psychology in 1855 and 1859, which were used by later experimental psychologists such as William James. His Spencer-Bain principle concerning probability of behavior recalls the later Behaviorist school in its conclusions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
thomas_brown;Thomas Brown;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
thomas_brown_desc;Thomas Brown was an associationist of the Scottish School, he added a secondary set of laws to complete the associationist philosophy. He built upon earlier work by broadening associationism to consider it as an active process of an active mind. This active process considered the effects of other associations, temperament and state of mind of the individual, the state of health of the body, as well as the circumstances of the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
francis_galton;Francis Galton;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
francis_galton_desc;Sir Francis Galton was a British aristocrat who wrote extensively on the measurement of an individual's mental abilities using sensory and motor tests. His 1869 work 'Hereditary Genius:  An Inquiry into its Laws and Consequences' argued that the children of geniuses tended to become geniuses themselves. He surveyed thousands of fellow academics, publishing in 1874 his findings that intelligence was primarily a heritable trait, although there was some necessity for environmental nurturance of that trait. He was the first to use identical and fraternal twins to measure the effects of nature versus nurture, and established in 1888 the theoretical basis for correlation, scatterplots, and regression as measurement tools.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alfred_binet;Alfred Binet;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alfred_binet_desc;Alfred Binet was a French psychologist who pioneered the use of standardized testing to measure individual differences in intelligence. The French government commissioned Binet and his student Theodore Simon to develop a test in 1899 to differentiate 'retarded' from 'normal' children. The Simon-Binet test divided intelligence into several areas and measured each with a battery of questions. Questions considered to measure higher ability were those answered more often by students whom their teachers had rated highly. Binet also believed that intelligences were inherited, but improvable by education. His test assigned a single 'mental-level' score to each subject based on their test results.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
charles_spearman;Charles Spearman;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
charles_spearman_desc;Charles Spearman was a British psychologist and mathematician. Spearman criticized Galton's tests as being too simple to measure intelligence. He preferred Binet's test, but criticized the use of a universal number to characterize different areas of intelligence. He developed the process of factor analysis, measuring correlations between performance in different test areas. He proposed two underlying factors 'g' for general intelligence to explain the correlations and 's' for specific abilities to explain the imperfections in his correlations. His 'g'factor was not a concrete number, but he too believed in the heritability of intelligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
eugenics;Eugenics;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
eugenics_desc;An outgrowth from Darwinistic ideas on natural selection and trait theories and from the studies in intelligence measurement, Eugenics was concerned with the mental and physical traits found in society and a response to the weaknesses found. Positive eugenics encouraged family programs, social welfare, and the importance of education in the desirability of breeding to increase the appearance of positive traits. Negative eugenics argued for the need to remove weak traits by removing undesirable elements, leading to sterilization and even extermination of target groups.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
wilhelm_wundt;Wilhelm Wundt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
wilhelm_wundt_desc;Wilhelm Wundt was a German physiologist who opened the first university-based psychological laborator in Leipzig in 1879. Wundt published the first textbook to identify psychology as a science. His 'two reaction-time' tasks demonstrated that complex sequences are the combination of more elementary processes. This was the foundation of Cognitive Psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
edward_titchener;Edward Titchener;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
edward_titchener_desc;Edward Titchener was an English psychologist who studied under Wundt at Leipzig. Titchener headed the psychology department at Cornell University and founded the Structuralist school, which relied heavily on introspection to perform analysis on the structure of the mind. His attempts to break down experiences into four basic elements was discredited because it was possible for different subjects to identify different elements from the same experiences.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
william_james;William James;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
william_james_desc;William James was an American psychologist and philosopher at Harvard University. James emphasized the the study of the purposes and functions of the mind, rather than its structure. James is considered the founder of the Functionalist school. He used experiments and introspection, but disclaimed introspection as scientific proof.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gs_hall;G. Stanley Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gs_hall_desc;G. Stanley Hall was the first President of the American Psychological Association. Hall founded the American Journal of Psychology in 1887. His research focused on educational psychology and adolescence. He adapted the term 'Storm and Stress' to characterize the period of adolescence.

His views on child development were later largely refuted by Piaget and Vygotsky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hermann_ebbinghaus;Hermann Ebbinghaus;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hermann_ebbinghaus_desc;Hermann Ebbinghaus was a German psychologist who pioneered studies in memory. Ebbinghaus used himself as subject in thousands of repetitions of his 'nonsense syllables.' Among his contributions to the field were the learning curve, the forgetting curve, and the serial position effect, which demonstrated that individuals remember the most recent information first presented. He documented 'savings': information relearned a second time is memorized faster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

alfred_adler;Alfred Adler;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alfred_adler_desc;Alfred Adler was an Austrian doctor and psychtherapist. Adler diverged from Freud in arguing that unconscious motivation could be better explained by teleological goals rather than instinctual drives. According to Adler, people are born with a feeling of Inferiority. People attempt to overcome these feelings of inferiority. Adler posited one of three outcomes. An 'inferiority complex' develops in people who are overwhelmed by these feelings. Some of these will develop a superiority complex to mask their true feelings. Psychologically healthy people manifest the concept of self-esteem and satsify their goals through a sense of personal achievement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

anna_freud_desc;The daughter of Sigmund Freud, Anna began her psychoanalytic practice in 1923. She served as secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association between 1925 and 1934. Freud became known for her work on the social importance of the ego in childhood development. She wrote 'Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense' (1936) in which she further developed the concept of defense mechanisms such as repression, displacement, reaction formation and rationalization. These are mental processes to reduce consciousness of wishes, memories and thoughts that prove threatening to self-esteem and security of the individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
karen_horney;Karen Horney;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
karen_horney_desc;Karen Horney was a German psychoanalyst. She came to criticize Freud's emphasis on sex and aggressive as motivating drives. Horney (1937) focused on security instead as the central, inborn human need. In her view, child development was contingent upon parental fulfillment of the child's 'basic anxiety' emotion. Success would result in a trusting individual, while failure would result in insecurity. Insecurity and distrust manifests itself in personality as either avoidance, submission or dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ivan_pavlov;Ivan Pavlov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ivan_pavlov_desc;Ivan Pavlov was a Russian physiologist and winner of the Nobel Prize for his work on reflexes in digestion. In the course of studies with dogs and salivation, Pavlov observed that the dogs elicited a certain type of salivation with certain signals that preceeded the arrival of food. In his 1927 study, Pavlov laid out the basic principles of classical conditioning in Behaviorism. The food was the unconditioned stimulus for salivation. The signal became associated with salivation as a conditioned stimulus, with salivation to the sound of the signal alone becoming the new conditioned response. Extinction, recovery, generalization and discrimination were identified in subsequent studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
el_thorndike;Edward L. Thorndike;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
el_thorndike_desc;Edward Lee Thorndike was an American researcher who also conducted experiments in animal learning. He was known for his puzzle-box procedure (1898), in which a hungry cat was placed inside a small cage and observed to see how long it took the cat to learn to pull the lever and escape, where food was waiting. He observed that after 20-30 trials, the cats had become efficient at escaping almost instantaneously. Thorndike formulated the law of effect, stating that responses producing a positive effect became more likely to occur again, and those producing discomfort were less likely to occur again. These observations were later transformed by B.F. Skinner into the concept of operant conditioning in psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jb_watson;John B. Watson;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jb_watson_desc;John Broadus Watson was an American psychologist who studied Pavlovian conditioning in humans. Watson's most famous experiment involved conditioning an 11-year old child named Albert to associate a conditioned stimulus (fear of rats) to an unconditioned stimulus (fear of a loud hammering sound). Watson's research later led to clinical treatments extinguishing irrational fears in people. After being dismissed from Harvard over an affair and marriage with a graduate student, Watson brought his research experience to a prominent advertising firm. Modern advertising owed much to behaviorist psychology and conditioning concepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ec_tolman;Edward C. Tolman;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ec_tolman_desc;Edward C. Tolman was another prominent American psychologist in the field of Behaviorism. Tolman performed maze experiments to demonstrate latent learning in animals. He showed that a rat could run the maze on the first try, if it was previously allowed to explore the maze while not hungry. Tolman evinced that the subject learned useful stimulus information about the world without reference to a reinforcing stimulus (the food). The ability to run the maze correctly on trial one demonstrated flexibility in the use of the learned information. Tolman's stimulus-stimulus (S-S) learning was opposed by the stimulus-response (S-R) orthodoxy of Skinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

tulls_seed_drill;Tull's Seed Drill;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tulls_seed_drill_desc;Up until this era, farmers planted the seeds for cereal crops by carrying the seeds in a bag and walking up and down the field throwing or broadcasting the seed. They broadcast the seed by hand on to the ploughed and harrowed ground. The problem with this method was that it did not give a very even distribution. It was not, therefore, an efficient use of the seed and much of it was wasted. Jethro Tull invented a Seed Drill which could be pulled behind a horse. It consisted of a wheeled vehicle containing a box filled with grain. There was a wheel-driven ratchet that sprayed the seed out evenly as the Seed Drill was pulled across the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

crystal_radio;Crystal Radio;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
crystal_radio_desc;A crystal radio receiver, also called a crystal set or cat's whisker receiver, is a very simple radio receiver, popular in the early days of radio. It needs no battery or power source and runs on the power received from radio waves by a long wire antenna. It gets its name from its most important component, known as a crystal detector, originally made with a piece of crystalline mineral such as galena.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
valve_radio_sets;Valve Radio Sets;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
valve_radio_sets_desc;With the discovery that triode valves could amplify signals it was soon noticed that they would also oscillate, a fact that was exploited in generating signals. Once the triode was established as an amplifier it made a tremendous difference to radio receiver performance as it allowed the incoming signals to be amplified. This gave significant improvements in the levels of gain that could be achieved, greatly increasing selectivity, enabling this type of receiver to outperform all other types of the era.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_white_mans_burden;The White Man's Burden;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_white_mans_burden_desc;'The White Man's Burden' was a poem by the English poet Rudyard Kipling, published in 1899. At face value it appeared to be a rhetorical command to white men to colonise and rule other nations for the benefit of those people (both the people and the duty may be seen as representing the 'burden' of the title), even though it mixed its  exhortation to empire with somber warnings of the costs involved in imperialism. Imperialists came to understand the phrase 'white man's burden' as a characterization for imperialism that justified the policy as a noble enterprise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_decline_of_the_west_and_the_lost_generation_desc;The combination of the dramatic social, economic and political transformations undertaken in the nineteenth century with the rise of industry and the devastation produced by mass warfare in the industrial age created a crisis of confidence among many intellectuals that the whole structure of society was under siege and in danger of complete collapse. Oswald Spengler began work on 'The Decline Of The West' in 1911 as the challenges of new social, political and economic forces were shaking advanded industrial societies to their cores, with Spengler concluding that what these societies were experiencing was part of the natural cycle of civilizations that rise, have a period of brilliance, and eventually decline and collapse – a direct challenge to the Victorian idea that modern industrial society could continually be improved as a result of humanity’s rational abilities. Coined by American author Gertrude Stein, 'The Lost Generation' captured the sense of loss and emptiness that many veterans of Great War felt after surviving the carnage of the battlefields and questioning the values and beliefs that had encouraged their nations to participate in the conflicts in the first place. These themes of decline and loss that Spengler and Woolf developed would dominate the cultural landscape in the early twentieth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
